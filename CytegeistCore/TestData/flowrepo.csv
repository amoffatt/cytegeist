FR-FCM-Z23S,FR-FCM-Z23S,2172,Development of a Comprehensive Antibody Staining Database using a Standardized Analytics Pipeline,The goal of this study was to apply a standardized CyTOF workflow and analysis pipeline in conjunction with the Biolegend Legendscreen kit to comprehensively screen surface protein expression patterns across all major defined immune cell subsets in peripheral blood and to evaluate the impact of fixation on these expression patterns,"We present a standardized workflow for the acquisition and analysis of large-scale immune monitoring studies using mass cytometry. The workflow incorporates several established experimental techniques in order to reduce signal variation within samples, across samples, and across operators. One, it utilizes a lyophilized core antibody panel that allows clear identification of major compartments of the immune system and provides higher resolution into T Cell, B Cell, and other subsets. Lyophilization streamlines sample processing and eliminates the variability inherent in pipetting small volumes from a large numbers of individual antibody vials. Two, a two-tiered barcoding scheme assures that all donors and treatments are acquired together and that samples are organized into batches. This reduces the technical variation associated with the instrument and its operation. Three, a fully automated cloud-based analytics platform (Astrolabe) runs the same quality control, data cleaning, cell subset labeling, and unsupervised clustering over the entire data set. Taken together, the workflow provides a flexible framework that can be easily adapted to clinical trial immune monitoring or other large-scale experiments and greatly improve the quality, reproducibility, robustness and utility of mass cytometry data.
                    
                    We leveraged this standardized workflow as part of a comprehensive screen to establish the expression of 350 surface markers across all major circulating immune subsets at single cell resolution. Acquisition of the entire expression dataset across three donors required more than a month of Helios operation and culminated in over 60 million events; one of the largest single mass cytometry datasets recorded to date.",,[Bioinformatics][screening][mass cytometry][CyTOF][Systems Biology][computational biology][immune monitoring],,,"[Conditions = Fixed(1105), Fresh(1089)]",2194,64,El-ad David Amir,Adeeb Rahman,El-ad David Amir,2018-08-21 -,2018-08-21,,2019-05-01,2019-05-01,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York, NY (United States of America)

This work utilized a Helios mass cytometer purchased using NIH Instrument grant S10 OD023547-01.,"Several quality control approaches were included in order to ensure the accuracy and quality of the antibody staining dataset. First, we employed a two-tier barcoding approach to minimize technical variability in performing the screen. The barcoded samples were deconvolved using an automated debarcoding approach that was directly compared and shown to perform comparably to manual debarcoding. Second, we used average overlap frequency (AOF) as a metric to evaluate the consistency of individual marker staining quality across all samples, which allows us to identify and
                    address acquisition batch effects. Third, we used an automated approach to identify and label cell subsets, the accuracy of which was validated against manual gating of each of the analogous subsets, demonstrating high overlap and consistency between these approaches. Fifth, we performed the screen using three independent donor blood samples to allow for an evaluation of the biological reproducibility of individual marker expression profiles, and each donor presented a consistent and distinct cell subset profile across the entire experiment with both the frequencies of the major immune compartments and the intensities of their canonical markers showing low variability across the entire acquisition period. Finally, the reproducibility of the antibody expression profiles in our primary screen were further validated using a second independent screen performed using an additional donor. Taken together, these steps highlight the fidelity of the antibody staining resource. However, it is still important to note the limitations of this data set as a high-throughput screen; any findings require independent follow-up to confirm whether the reported expression patterns truly reflect hitherto unknown phenotypic diversity or may reflect specific biological or technical aspects of this screen.",,,Samples_PEmarker.csv,53274.563,24.282,2194,13834.917,6.306,FCS3.0(2194),DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-1.0.0(2194)

Since 2006 the EuroFlow consortium has been developing a standardized procedure detailing the whole process from instrument settings to data analysis. The FranceFlow group was created in 2010 with the intention to educate participating centres in France about the standardised instrument setting protocol (SOP) developed by the EuroFlow consortium and to organise several rounds of quality controls (QCs) in order to evaluate the feasibility of its application and its results. Here, we report the 5 year experience of the FranceFlow group and the results of the seven QCs of 23 instruments, involving up to 19 centres, in France and in Belgium.","The FranceFlow group demonstrates that both the distribution and applicability of the SOP have been successful. Inter-center reproducibility was evaluated using both normal and pathological blood samples. Coefficients of variation (CVs) across the centers were <7% for the percentages of cell subsets and <30% for the MFIs of the markers tested. Intra-center reproducibility provided similar results with CVs of <3% for the percentages of the majority of cell subsets, and CVs of <20% for the MFI values for the majority of markers. Altogether, the FranceFlow group show that the 19 participating labs might be considered as one unique laboratory with 23 identical flow cytometers able to reproduce identical results. Therefore, SOP significantly improves reproducibility of clinical flow in hematology and opens new avenues by providing a robust companion diagnostic tool for clinical trials in hematology.",,[Quality control][interlaboratory comparisons],,,,,25,Ludovic LHERMITTE,Ludovic LHERMITTE,Ludovic LHERMITTE,2010-01-01 - 2017-12-30,2010-01-01,2017-12-30,2019-06-01,2024-04-01,"FranceFlow group, Paris,  (France)",Not disclosed,None,,,,32356.989,65.105,497,1643.241,3.306,"FCS3.0(468), FCS3.1(29)","FACSCantoII(313), (159), FACSCantoII  CANTO1 (FACSCantoII)(7), FACSCanto #1 (FACSCantoII)(6), FACSCanto #2 (FACSCantoII)(6), FACSCantoII  CANTO 2 (FACSCantoII)(6)"

FR-FCM-Z24C,FR-FCM-Z24C,2188,The simplified human intestinal microbiota (SIHUMIx) shows high structural and functional resistance against changing transit times in in vitro bioreactors,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health since it is involved in many metabolic interactions with the host. Among the human population, different intestinal transit times were observed and are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition. However, effects on structure and function are not fully understood. Hence, we cultivated the model community SIHUMIx in bioreactors in order to determine the effects of varying transit times on the community structure and function.","Although simplified bacterial communities are expected to be less stable against environmental stressors, SIHUMIx showed remarkable structural and functional resistance against varying physiological TT. Also correlation analysis revealed little correlation between species abundances or SCFA concentration and TT, indicating high resistance of SIHUMIx against varying physiological TT. Fingerprinting tools provided a fast and reproducible approach to assess microbial community dynamics and revealed slight changes in the community structure of SIHUMIx during varying TT. According to our Metaproteomics data these changes were associated with differences in membrane transport, glycan and protein metabolism and consequently thereby also with absolute SCFA and BCFA concentrations. B. thetaiotamicron was identified to be affected in terms of butyrate production, which has as important implication in relation to intestinal health. Despite the lihemitation for the relative low abundant species this study showed that the low complexity of SIHUMIx allowed describing the effect of physiological stressors on a species specific level.",,[flow cytometry][Bioreactor][SIHUMIx][metabolomics][short chain fatty acids][In vitro model][metaproteomics][intestinal microbiota],[31816881],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816881, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956075",,,78,Florian Schattenberg,Florian Schattenberg,Florian Schattenberg,2017-08-01 - 2018-02-28,2017-08-01,2018-02-28,2019-06-01,2019-06-01,"Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ,  Env. microbiology, Leipzig,  (Germany)","German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) for the support of Jannike Lea Krause.

FR-FCM-Z26Y,FR-FCM-Z26Y,2241,Characterization of Leukocytes from HIV-ART Patients Using Combined Cytometric Profiles of 72 Cell Markers - Validation panel,"Motivation: Mass cytometry is an experimental technique used to measure the intensity levels of proteins expressed by cells, at a single cell resolution. This technique is essential to characterize the phenotypes and functions of immune cell populations, but is currently limited to the measurement of 40 cell markers, which restricts the characterization of complex diseases. However, bioinformatics algorithms and multi-tube cytometry techniques have been designed for combining phenotypic information obtained from different cytometric panels. The characterization of chronic HIV represents a good study case for multi-tube mass cytometry as this disease triggers a complex interactions network of more than 70 cell markers. Method: We collected whole blood from non-viremic HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapies and healthy donors. Leukocytes from each individual were stained using three different mass cytometry panels, which consisted of 35, 32, and 33 cell markers. For each patient and using the CytoBackBone algorithm, we combined the phenotypic information from three different antibody panels into a single cytometric profile, reaching a phenotypic resolution of 72 cell parameters. These high-resolution cytometric profiles were analyzed using SPADE and viSNE algorithms to decipher in deep the immune response to HIV. Results: We detected an upregulation of several proteins in HIV-infected patients relative to heathy donors using our profiling of 72 cell markers. Among them, CD11a and CD11b were upregulated in PMNs, monocytes, mDCs, NK cells, and T cells. CD11b was also upregulated on pDCs. Other upregulated proteins included: CD38 on PMNs, monocytes, NK cells, basophils, B cells and T cells; CD83 on monocytes, mDCs, B cells, and T cells; and TLR2, CD32, and CD64 on PMNs and monocytes. These results were validated using a single mass cytometry panel of 25 cells markers. Impacts: We demonstrate here that multi-tube cytometry can be applied to mass cytometry for exploring, at an unprecedented level of details, cell populations impacted by complex diseases. Thanks to our methodology, we show that the monocyte and PMN populations were strongly affected by the HIV infection, as CD11a, CD11b, CD32, CD38, CD64, CD83, CD86, and TLR2 were upregulated in these populations. Overall, these results show that HIV infection induced a specific environment that similarly affected multiple immune cells in these patients.","In HIV-ART patients, chronic inflammation highly disturbes the phenotype of immune cells.",,[high-dimensional cytometry][biomarkers][Cytometric profiles merging][HIV infection][Chronic inflammation],,,"[Conditions = HEA(6), HIV(6)]",12,84,Nicolas Tchitchek,Nicolas Tchitchek,Nicolas Tchitchek,2017-06-01 - 2018-06-01,2017-06-01,2018-06-01,2019-07-01,2019-07-01,"CEA,  Division of Immuno-Virology, DSV/iMETI, Fontenay-aux-Roses,  (France)",The IDMIT infrastructure is supported by the French government “Programme d’Investissements d’Avenir” (PIA) under Grant ANR-11-INBS-0008 and grant ANR-10-EQPX-02-01 (FlowCyTech facility).,CyTOF QC was checked before each acquisition.,,,,3662.686,305.224,12,670.695,55.891,FCS3.0(12),DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-6.5.358(12)

                    Our WNV dataset quantifies the immune response of WNV-infected mice over eight days: from day 0 (no infection) to day 7. For each day, immune cells were extracted from the bone marrow of four mice and analysed by flow cytometer. Of them, 190,000 cells from each day were obtained for ChronoClust. Expression levels of nine proteins were measured per cell: (1) B220, (2) CD3/NK11, (3) Ly6C, (4) CD115, (5) CD11b, (6) Ly6G, (7) SSC-A, (8) CD117, (9) SCA-1

The detection of ILCs in small volumes of whole blood and respiratory paediatric samples was successfully demonstrated. Finally, the impact of different protocols of cryopreservation and stabilisation of whole blood and airways cells was assessed. Our data clearly show that innate lymphocytes from paediatric samples must be processed fresh, so this will be applied to all samples collected in the future.

FR-FCM-Z293,FR-FCM-Z293,2339,Characterization of Phenotypes and Functional Activities of Leukocytes from Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients by Mass Cytometry.," Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune rheumatic disease and leads to persistent chronic inflammation. The pathophysiology of the disease is complex, involving both adaptive and innate immunity. Among innate immune cells, neutrophils have been rarely studied due to their sensitivity to freezing and their not being collected after Ficoll purification.","We show that RA induces the presence of CD11blow neutrophils (33.7% and 9.2% of neutrophils in RA and controls, respectively) associated with the duration of disease. This population additionally exhibited heterogeneous expression of CD16. We also characterized a CD11ahigh Granzyme Bhigh T-cell population possibly associated with disease activity. There was no difference in cytokine expression after the stimulation of immune cells by TLR agonists between RA and controls.","Methods: We used mass cytometry to perform a multidimensional phenotypic characterization of immune cells from RA-treated patients, which included the simultaneous study of 33 intra- or extra-cellular markers expressed by leukocytes. We were able to focus our study on innate immune cells, especially neutrophils, due to a specific fixation method before freezing.

It ensures reproducibility and reliability on future blood studies when performing further upstream analysis, such as of mass cytometry or flow cytometry. However, we also show that blood cell fixation can affect marker recognition in addition to cell permeabilization. It is therefore recommended that working antibody panels are evaluated prior to fixation.","First, antibody binding to cell surface markers on cryopreserved PBMC (cPBMC) and Fixed buffy coat (FixedBC) was evaluated. Additionally, from the markers studied, the least affected were chosen to assemble two different panels:
                    - monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells
                    - natural killer (NK) cells and T cells
                    We compared the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the positive population from cPBMC and FixedBC.

In the present study, we introduce a suitable standard for the analysis of microbial communities by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry has become an essential technology for the quantitative study of natural or artificially-constructed microbial communities in ecosystems, biotechnology, and health research. De Vrieze et al. highlighted the need for phenotypic microbial community data in the field of biotechnology for the upcoming automation process in Industry 4.0. In addition, research only begins to uncover the ecology of microbial communities in managed and natural systems. Therefore, the  technology is especially useful for monitoring dynamics and evolution of communities; and bioinformatics tools are available to identify ecological concepts of community structuring processes and to reveal stability properties4 as well as interactions between subpopulations of microorganisms and their environment. Such applications require absolute comparability of the cytometric data over days up to years. A standard mock community has been developed that validates accurate cell treatment, tests high-resolution cytometer alignment, and ensures proper use of bioinformatics pipelines.","Here, we developed an artificial microbial Cytometric Mock Community (mCMC) as a reference standard and benchmark for high quality data.

The goal of this study was to better understand how daclizumab beta altered the NK cell repertoire to provide further insight into the possible mechanism(s) of action in Multiple Sclerosis.,"The data demonstrate that significant changes occur in NK cells in response to the increased IL-2 availability induced by daclizumab beta treatment. These data extend prior findings indicating that daclizumab beta treatment increases the frequency of the CD56bright population, which is not due to an increase of a specific subset of CD56bright NK cells. NK receptor expression is broadly altered across CD56bright NK cells, highlighting the unique phenotypic features of these expanded NK cells. The high expression of activation markers, activating receptors, and perforin could enhance the ability of these CD56bright NK cells to control RMS through cytolytic activity or other immunoregulatory functions. The deep profiling of NK cells performed here, including in the placebo group, can also serve as a reference for future studies of NK cell phenotype

                    A laboratory experiment was designed in which tap water was spiked with wastewater. The set-up consisted of a stirred tank through which tap water was continuously flowed and an automated flow cytometer connected to the inside of the vessel made measurements every 30 minutes. The purpose of the experiment was to assess whether the MCCD model (Microbial Community Change Detection) which is based on cytometric fingerprints and distance-based outlier calculation, better detected the spikes than the cell concentration. The experiment lasted 7 days, and 7 wastewater spikes as well as a blank spike (tap water spike) were performed.
                  ","The MCCD was more performant in detecting the spiking times than the cell concentration. The concentration in the tap water underwent strong fluctuations which obscured the peaks observed during the spiking times, while a clear signal was obtained by the outlier score (output of the MCCD model) which increased during the spikes and remained flat otherwise.","The .fcs files are organized as follows:

FR-FCM-Z2JL,FR-FCM-Z2JL,2677,Transcriptional programming of alveolar macrophages reveals major changes in lipid metabolism in COPD,"                    Rationale: Immune cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Albeit changes in distribution and cellular functions of major immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages (AMs) and neutrophils have been established, we still do not fully understand their transcriptional reprogramming and contribution to the pathophysiology of COPD. 
                    Objective: To determine changes in immune cell type distribution, transcriptional reprogramming and lipid metabolism in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of COPD patients.
                    Methods: Multi-color flow cytometry (MCFC) was applied using most current cell-type-determining markers to BAL samples from 29 controls and 30 COPD patients at different clinical stages. Whole transcriptomes and lipidomes were analyzed in sorted CD45+Lin-HLA-DR+CD66b-Autofluoreschencehi AMs. 
                    Measurements and Main Results: Neutrophil, group 1 and group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC), but not AM absolute cell numbers were significantly increased in COPD patients. Focusing on AMs as the largest cell type in the alveolar space, we defined global transcriptional reprogramming and detected significant changes between controls and COPD patients in genes involved in lipid metabolism. Based on these findings, lipidomic assessment of a total of 249 lipid species in sorted AMs revealed changes of cholesteryl ester (CE), monoacylglycerols (MAG) and phosphatidylcholines (PC) in a stage-dependent manner.

                    During mammalian pregnancy, immune cells are vertically transferred from mother to fetus. The functional role of these maternal microchimeric cells (MMc) in the offspring is largely unknown. We established mouse models in which MMc frequencies are reduced, which enables functional assessment of MMc. Here we report a functional role of MMc in promoting fetal immune development. A key finding is the MMc-triggered preferential differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in fetal bone marrow towards monocytes within the myeloid compartment. Neonatal mice with higher numbers of MMc and monocytes show an improved resilience against cytomegalovirus infection.

Our data highlight the importance of MMc in promoting fetal immune development, subsequently averting the threats caused by early life exposure to pathogens.

To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, cytokine profiling was performed in mild-moderate and critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differed from the IFN-γ-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, but was increased in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Prediction modelling of cytokine levels followed by deep-immune profiling showed that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that both a quantitative and qualitative reduction in T-lymphocytes correlate with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules was reduced in critical disease, while also neutrophils contributed to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplifying hypercytokinemia and neutrophil extracellular trap formation.

The orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA_Pyl_CUA (PylT) pair from Methanosarcina mazei was stably expressed in these cell lines: HEK293T_RS and mESC R26_RS. Two fluorescent reporters were used to assess general amber suppression efficiency and incorporation of the ncAAs tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-lysine (BocK), methyl-diazirin-L-lysine (DiazK), and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne-L-lysine (BcnK) in stable mouse ESCs: 4xPylT/sfGFP_N150TAG and 4xPylT/mCherry-TAG-EGFP. Furthermore, to assess TAG sequence context dependent efficiency of amber suppression across multiple incorporation sites within a target sequence (GOI* or context*), the mScarlet/mNeonGreen (mSc/mNG) dual-fluorescence reporter was applied in stable HEK293T and mouse ESCs: 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-GOI*-P2A-mNG or 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-context*-P2A-mNG. Incorporation efficiencies of DiazK and BcnK at different locations were quantified for amber mutants of the histones H2A and H3 as well as for the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) according to mSc/mNG mean fluorescence intensities. Additionally, incorporation efficiencies of DiazK and BcnK at varrying synthetic sequence contexts (+/- 6 nts flanking TAG; context*) in the C-terminus of H2A were analyzed.",HEK293T and mESCs with a stably expanded genetic code were generated. All cell lines suppress TAG thereby incorporating the respective ncAA. The 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-GOI*-P2A-mNG or 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-context*-P2A-mNG dual-fluorescence reporter reproducibly yields context-specific amber suppression efficiencies. Amber suppression efficiency varies several fold depending on the sequence context.,"The used mouse ESC line is J1. An evolved PylRS/PylT pair was used to incorporate DiazK or BcnK. All analyzed HEK293T and mESC lines stably expressed the PylRS/PylT pair. mESCs were transiently transfected with the 4xPylT/mCherry-TAG-EGFP reporter. mESCs stably expressed the 4xPylT/sfGFP_N150TAG, 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-GOI*-P2A-mNG, or 4xPylT/mSc-P2A-context*-P2A-mNG reporter.

Kilgour et al.,"Immune regulatory metabolites are key features of the tumor microenvironment (TME), yet with a few exceptions, their identities remain largely unknown. Here, we profiled tumor and T cells from tumor and ascites of patients with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) to uncover the metabolomes of these distinct TME compartments. Cells within the ascites and tumor had pervasive metabolite differences, with a striking enrichment in 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in T cells infiltrating the tumor compared to ascites. Despite the elevated levels of MNA in T cells, the expression of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to nicotinamide, was restricted to fibroblasts and tumor cells. T cells treated with MNA stimulated secretion of the tumor promoting cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Two main reasons are behind the unculturability  of bacteria: are the presence of cells in a viable but not culturable state (such as dormant cells),) and the failure to provide the necessary growth requirements in vitro (leading to the classification of some bacterial taxa as yet-to-be-cultured). The present work focuses on the development of a single procedure that helps distinguish between both phenomena of unculturability, based on viability staining coupled with flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In the selected soil sample, the success rate of cultured bacteria was doubled by selecting viable and metabolically active bacteria, and it. It was determined that most of the uncultured fraction was not dormant or dead but likely required different growth conditions. It was also determined that the staining process introduced changes in the taxonomic composition of the outgrown bacterial biomass, which should be considered for further developments. This research shows the potential of flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting applied to soil samples to improve the success rate of bacterial cultivation by estimating the proportion of dormant and yet-to-be-cultured bacteria and by directly excluding dormant cells from being inoculated into growth media.",None,,,,,,,15,Laura Espina,Laura Espina,Laura Espina,2018-04-12 -,2018-04-12,,2020-07-01,2020-08-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,,fcsfiles.pdf,613.396,34.078,18,27.557,1.531,FCS3.0(18),FACSAriaIII(18)

Notably, we found that high expression of ACE2 was colocalized with tissue macrophages of the lung (alveolar macrophages), and up-regulated on the activated M1 macrophages. However, most immune cells in human peripheral blood were negative for ACE2 expression, including the freshly-isolated CD14+ monocytes. It implies that the circulating monocytes may differentiate into alveolar macrophages after migration into the pulmonary tissues with an up-regulation of ACE2 expression. These alveolar macrophages act as the front line immune cells defending against the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.

FR-FCM-Z2WB,FR-FCM-Z2WB,2635,Human CD4+ and CD8+ T Lymphocytes have Significantly Different Surface Expression Patterns of CD226 and TIGIT Molecules,"In this study, we aimed to compare pre- and post-stimulation CD226 and TIGIT expression profiles to those of CD28, in human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, using flow cytometry. The impact of the CD226 single nucleotide polymorphism, rs763361, on cell surface CD226 expression and effector cytokine secretion was also examined.","In this study, cell surface expression of CD226 and TIGIT, by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulations, of healthy donors before and after stimulation, was investigated. The results obtained indicate that most naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not express CD226 and TIGIT, predominantly upregulating activating receptors following stimulation. Memory CD4+ T cells exhibited balanced expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, pre- and post-stimulation. In contrast, memory CD8+ T cells predominantly expressed TIGIT. Degranulating cytotoxic T cells were characterized by high and low expression levels of activating receptor and inhibitory receptor, respectively. The rs763361 TT genotype was associated with both a reduction in CD226 expression on the cell surface of CD4+ memory T cells (p = 0.004) and increased interleukin 17A secretion from activated T cells (p = 0.036, measured from culture medium). Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism through which rs763361 can affect T cell function, creating a predisposition for autoimmune disease development. Description of different expression patterns on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes provided in this work will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the CD226/TIGIT axis in control over T cell activation and suppression.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy blood donors (n = 65) were studied.,[IL-22][IL-17][IFNg][T cells][CD28][CD226][TIGIT],,,,,79,Marina Sunina,Kai Kisand,Marina Sunina,2017-04-22 - 2017-05-25,2017-04-22,2017-05-25,2020-03-01,2020-07-01,"University of Tartu,  Department of Immunology, Tartu,  (Estonia)","This study was supported by the EU Regional Developmental Fund and the Estonian Research Council grants (IUT20-43, PUT1367 and PRG 712).","Cytometer Setup & Tracking Beads (BD Biosciences);

Biotinylated cholesterol absorption inhibitor C-5 (i.e. derivative of ezetimibe) was rapidly internalized to perinuclear tubular structures of cells, resembling endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but CD13 was detected on extracellular sites of the plasma membrane and endo-lysosomal vesicles. Administration of ezetimibe, but not of glucuronidated ezetimibe or S6130, was associated with decreased cellular cholesteryl ester content, indicating the sterol-O acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1)-inhibition by ezetimibe. Furthermore, ezetimibe decreased the expression of molecules involved in cholesterol uptake and synthesis, in parallel with increased apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and up-regulation of efflux-effectors. However, NPC1L1 the other claimed molecular target of ezetimibe, was not detected in macrophages, thereby excluding this protein as target for ezetimibe in macrophages.
                    Ezetimibe is very likely a CD13-linked microdomain-disruptor and SOAT1-inhibitor in macrophages leading to in vitro anti-atherosclerotic effects through a decrease of net cellular cholesterol content.",,,[30994973],http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994973,,,0,Evelyn Orso,Evelyn Orso,Evelyn Orso,2019-04-01 - 2019-04-01,2019-04-01,2019-04-01,2019-04-01,2019-06-01,None,Not disclosed,"Recording and subtraction of autofluorescence,

Using COMPARE to analyze high-throughput flow cytometry screening of AML cells, we successfully removed various biases and grouped drugs based on their responses. COMPARE effectively revealed that groups of drugs showed similar responses even though their known mechanisms are different from each other. COMPARE was sensitive enough to capture subtle changes in drug responses. We further applied COMPARE to 25 clinical flow cytometry data sets representing AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Without prior knowledge, COMPARE could effectively group the samples based on the disease with indications that  the grouping also linked to clinical outcome. Thus we conclude that COMPARE is a useful tool for exploring complex multiparametric datasets and to help interpretation of drug responses.","AML primary splenic cells from Npm1+/cA ; Flt3+/ITD; Dnmt3a+/-; Mx1-Cre+ moribund mice were sorted for c-Kit positivity and expanded ex vivo.

FR-FCM-Z375,FR-FCM-Z375,3301,Comparison of extracellular vesicle isolation and storage methods using high-sensitivity flow cytometry,"                    Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are of interest for a wide variety of biomedical applications. A major limitation for the clinical use of EVs is the lack of standardized methods for the fast and reproducible separation and subsequent detection of EV subpopulations from biofluids, as well as their storage. To advance this application area, fluorescence-based characterization technologies with single-EV resolution, such as high-sensitivity flow cytometry (HS-FCM), are powerful to allow assessment of EV fractionation methods and storage conditions. Furthermore, the use of HS-FCM and fluorescent labeling of EV subsets is expanding due to the potential of high-throughput, multiplex analysis, but requires further method development to enhance the reproducibility of measurements. 
                    In this study, we have applied HS-FCM measurements next to standard EV characterization techniques, including nanoparticle tracking analysis, to compare the yield and purity of EV fractions obtained from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytic THP-1 cells by two EV isolation methods, differential centrifugation followed by ultracentrifugation and the exoEasy membrane affinity spin column purification. We observed differences in EV yield and purity. In addition, we have investigated the influence of EV storage at 4°C or -80°C for up to one month on the EV concentration and the stability of EV-associated fluorescent labels. The concentration of the in vitro cell derived EV fractions was shown to remain stable under the tested storage conditions, however, the fluorescence intensity of labeled EV stored at 4°C started to decline within one day.

FR-FCM-Z38Q,FR-FCM-Z38Q,3354,dCas12a CRISPRi,Evaluation of dCas12a CRISPRi for downregulation of gene expression in baker's yeast,"CRISPR Cas12a is an RNA-programmable endonuclease particularly suitable for gene regulation. This is due to its preference for T-rich PAMs that allows it to more easily target AT-rich promoter sequences, and built-in RNase activity which can process a single CRISPR RNA array encoding multiple spacers into individual guide RNAs (gRNAs), thereby simplifying multiplexed gene regulation. Here, we develop a flexible dCas12a-based CRISPRi system for S. cerevisiae and systematically evaluate its design features. This includes the role of the NLS position, use of repression domains, and the position of the gRNA target. Our optimal system is comprised of dCas12a E925A with a single C-terminal NLS and a Mxi1 or a MIG1 repression domain, which enables up to 97% downregulation of a reporter gene. We also extend this system to allow for inducible regulation via an RNAP II-controlled promoter, demonstrate position-dependent effects in crRNA arrays, and use multiplexed regulation to stringently control a heterologous β-carotene pathway. Together these findings offer valuable insights into the design constraints of dCas12a-based CRISPRi and enable new avenues for flexible and efficient gene regulation in S. cerevisiae.",,[Gene expression][Saccharomyces cerevisiae][CRISPRi],[34197613],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197613, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287914",,,47,Klaudia Ciurkot,Klaudia Ciurkot,Klaudia Ciurkot,2019-01-01 - 2020-12-01,2019-01-01,2020-12-01,2020-12-01,2021-07-01,"DSM Biotechnology Center , Delft ,  (Netherlands)","This project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant number 764591].

Using COMPARE to analyze high-throughput flow cytometry screening of AML cells, we successfully removed various biases and grouped drugs based on their responses. COMPARE effectively revealed that groups of drugs showed similar responses even though their known mechanisms are different from each other. COMPARE was sensitive enough to capture subtle changes in drug responses. We further applied COMPARE to 25 clinical flow cytometry data sets representing AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Without prior knowledge, COMPARE could effectively group the samples based on the disease with indications that  the grouping also linked to clinical outcome. Thus we conclude that COMPARE is a useful tool for exploring complex multiparametric datasets and to help interpretation of drug responses.","Mononuclear cells were isolated from a donated human bone marrow aspirate from an AML patient.

Using COMPARE to analyze high-throughput flow cytometry screening of AML cells, we successfully removed various biases and grouped drugs based on their responses. COMPARE effectively revealed that groups of drugs showed similar responses even though their known mechanisms are different from each other. COMPARE was sensitive enough to capture subtle changes in drug responses. We further applied COMPARE to 25 clinical flow cytometry data sets representing AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Without prior knowledge, COMPARE could effectively group the samples based on the disease with indications that the grouping also linked to clinical outcome. Thus we conclude that COMPARE is a useful tool for exploring complex multiparametric datasets and to help interpretation of drug responses.","Clinical flow cytometry data using a slightly modified AML panel as described by the Euroflow Consortium from 25 bone marrow aspirates from MDS and AML patients from Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, DK) were used for analysis. Each sample was analyzed using a total of four tubes (Euroflow AML panel tubes 1-4) with eight antibodies in each tube. Acquisition of data was performed on a FACS Canto (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) and data analysis was done in the Infinicyt software (Cytognos, Salamanca, Spain).

                    Estimating the time of delivery is of high clinical importance because pre- and postterm deviations are associated with complications for the mother and her offspring. However, current estimations are inaccurate. As pregnancy progresses toward labor, major transitions occur in fetomaternal immune, metabolic, and endocrine systems that culminate in birth. The comprehensive characterization of maternal biology that precedes labor is key to understanding these physiological transitions and identifying predictive biomarkers of delivery. Here, a longitudinal study was conducted in 63 women who went into labor spontaneously. More than 7000 plasma analytes and peripheral immune cell responses were analyzed using untargeted mass spectrometry, aptamer-based proteomic
                    technology, and single-cell mass cytometry in serial blood samples collected during the last 100 days of pregnancy. The high-dimensional dataset was integrated into a multiomic model that predicted the time to spontaneous labor [R = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.79 to 0.89], P = 1.2 × 10e−40, N = 53, training set; R = 0.81, 95% CI [0.61 to 0.91], P = 3.9 × 10e−7, N = 10, independent test set]. Coordinated alterations in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome marked a molecular shift from pregnancy maintenance to prelabor biology 2 to 4 weeks before delivery. A surge in steroid hormone metabolites and interleukin-1 receptor type 4 that preceded labor coincided with a switch from immune activation to regulation of inflammatory responses. Our study lays the groundwork for developing blood-based methods for predicting the day of labor, anchored in mechanisms shared in preterm and term pregnancies.

Mass cytometry data,Effect of PD-L1 engagment on CD4 cells,"Programmed death cell receptor 1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. High levels of expression are found on T cells during chronic infection, on tumour-infiltrating T cells and memory T cells. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in most tumour environments, and its binding to PD-1 on T cells drives them either to apoptosis or conversion into regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the fact that PD-L1 itself is also expressed on T cells upon activation has been largely neglected. In this study, we demonstrated that cross-linking of PD-L1 on human CD25-depleted CD4+ T cells, in combination with signalling through CD3/TCR induces their conversion into highly suppressive T cells. Furthermore, this effect was most prominent in memory T cells. PD-L1 co-stimulation on T cells resulted in reduced levels of ERK phosphorylation and decreased mTOR signalling. Importantly, T cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibited high basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and following PD-L1 cross-linking ERK signalling failed to be down modulated, making them resistant to Treg conversion. Altogether our results suggest that engagement of PD-L1 on memory T cells could play an important role in resolving inflammatory responses and its failure could contribute to ongoing autoimmunity.",FCS files of manually gated live cells following normalization,[PD/PD-L1][mass cytometry][Tregs],,,"[Conditions = AntiCD3(3), AntiCD3_CD28(3), AntiCD3_PD-L1(3)]",9,65,Marco Romano,Marco Romano,Marco Romano,2019-02-13 - 2021-03-19,2019-02-13,2021-03-19,2021-02-01,2021-03-01,"King's College London,  King's College London, London, London (United Kingdom)",British Heart Foundation,"<a href=""/experiments/211"">CD and intracellular antigen analysis</a>",211|CD and intracellular antigen analysis,,,2250.196,250.022,9,626.66,69.629,FCS3.0(9),DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-6.7.1014(9)

FR-FCM-Z3HA,FR-FCM-Z3HA,3626,Phenotyping human T cells in whole blood obtained from healthy volunteers experimentally infected with Plasmodium vivax,"Plasmodium vivax offers unique challenges for control and elimination, and may prove a tougher hurdle to overcome than Plasmodium falciparum. And yet compared to P. falciparum we know very little about the innate and adaptive immune responses that need to be harnessed to reduce disease and transmission. We recently generated a blood bank of a new clonal field isolate of P. vivax (PvW1) for human challenge studies and used systems immunology tools to track the host response throughout infection and convalescence.","These data show that Plasmodium vivax triggers the indiscriminate recruitment of innate-like and adaptive T cells to inflamed tissues (most likely the spleen) during infection. All major T cell subsets are recruited proportionally leading to a loss of 35-70% circulating lymphocytes at the peak of infection. After drug treatment (and clearance of parasites) T cells return to circulation at near-normal levels; remarkably, 10-20% of the T cell compartment has an activated (CD38hi Bcl2lo) phenotype at this time-point. On average, more than half of all activated cells are CD4+ and most display an effector memory phenotype. Activated CD4+ T cells are phenotypically heterogeneous, displaying diverse expression profiles of activation, differentiation and proliferation markers. They also demonstrate marked variation in their expression of key checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, these data suggest a potent stimulatory environment during human malaria that leads to the global recruitment and activation of T cells, and the polarisation of CD4+ T cells towards a Th1 fate.","Staining and acquisition was performed at the MRC Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine in Oxford, UK, in collaboration with Michalina Mazurczyk and Giorgio Napolitani.
                    
                    CyTOF was used to resolve changes in the peripheral T cell pool through time in six volunteers (named v02, v03, v05, v06, v07, v09). Demographic information of this cohort is shown in a spreadsheet attached to this experiment. Each volunteer was sampled at four timepoints: C-1 (one day before infection), C10, (ten days after infection) DoD (day of diagnosis, immediately before treatment), T+6 (six days post-treatment). The filename contains both the timepoint and individual from whom the sample was taken.
                    
                    FCS files were generated using CyTOF software (version 6.7, Fluidigm). All further processing and analysis was carried out in R.

High levels of expression are found on T cells during chronic infection, on tumour-infiltrating T cells and memory T cells. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in most tumour environments, and its binding to PD-1 on T cells drives them either to apoptosis or conversion into regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the fact that PD-L1 itself is also expressed on T cells upon activation has been largely neglected. In this study, we demonstrated that cross-linking of PD-L1 on human CD25-depleted CD4+ T cells, in combination with signalling through CD3/TCR induces their conversion into highly suppressive T cells. Furthermore, this effect was most prominent in memory T cells. PD-L1 co-stimulation on T cells resulted in reduced levels of ERK phosphorylation and decreased mTOR signalling. Importantly, T cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibited high basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and following PD-L1 cross-linking ERK signalling failed to be down modulated, making them resistant to Treg conversion. Altogether our results suggest that engagement of PD-L1 on memory T cells could play an important role in resolving inflammatory responses and its failure could contribute to ongoing autoimmunity.",IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS,[CD4][PD-L1][Tregs],,,"[Conditions = ANTICD3(12), ANTICD3-CD28(11), ANTICD3-PD-L1(9), UNSTIMULATED(9)]",41,54,Marco Romano,Marco Romano,Marco Romano,2019-04-01 - 2021-03-20,2019-04-01,2021-03-20,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,"King's College London,  King's College London, London, London (United Kingdom)

                    The acquisition of mesenchymal traits leads to immune evasion in various cancers, but the molecular mechanisms that link tumor immune evasiveness and mesenchymal phenotypes remain unclear. We found that the expression levels of AT-rich interaction domain containing protein 5a (Arid5a), an RNA-binding protein, is substantially increased in mesenchymal tumor subtypes.
                  ","The deletion of Arid5a in tumor cell lines enhanced antitumor immunity in immunocompetent mice but not in immunodeficient mice, highlighting the role of Arid5a in immune evasion. Furthermore, an Arid5a-deficient tumor microenvironment was shown to have robust antitumor immunity, as manifested by the suppressed infiltration of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T-cells, whereas infiltrated Tlymphocytes were more cytotoxic and less exhausted. Mechanistically, Arid5a stabilized Ido1 and Ccl2 mRNAs and augmented their expression, resulting in enhanced tryptophan catabolism and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, our findings demonstrate the role of Arid5a beyond inflammatory diseases, and suggest Arid5a as a promising target for the treatment of immunotolerant malignant tumors.","In these uploaded experiments the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from murine Wildtype or Arid5a KO PDAC and MC38 tumors were assessed by mass cytometry.

FR-FCM-Z3N9,FR-FCM-Z3N9,3817,detecting RBCs rotation with impedance based systems,"The Coulter principle is a widespread technique for the sizing of red blood cells in hematological analyzers. It is based on the monitoring of the electrical perturbations generated by the cells when they go through a polarized aperture. However, artifacts associated with near-wall passages in the sensing region are known to skew the statistics for red blood cells sizing. Numerical results presented in the manuscript show how RBCs deform and rotate in the sensing region, provided they flow near the walls of the measurement orifice. Such dynamics generate spurious electrical pulses responsible for the overestimation of RBC volumes. We propose two methods for detecting and rejecting electrical pulses spoiled by rotation in order to provide volume assessments more accurate. The experiments presented in this work assess the accuracy of the aforementioned pulse-editing methods, by comparison with hydrodynamical focusing, the gold standard implementation of Coulter principle which enforces cells to flow in the center of the orifice.","The filtering methods are shown to retrieve symmetrical volume distributions of red blood cells, in agreement with results from a hydrofocused system. Moreover, good correlations are obtained with the hydrofocused system in terms of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and RBCs distribution width (RDW).","Four sets of experimental results are presented: 1) Results from a Coulter counter equipped with hydrodynamical focusing 2) Results from a classical Coulter counter 3) Results From a classical Coulter counter when applying a first pulse editing method, based on the calculation of a metric from the electrical pulse. 4) Results from a classical Coulter counter when applying a second pulse editing method, allowed by a Neural Network. Configurations (1), (2), (3) and (4) are referred as HF, noHF, noHF-R and noHF-NN in the manuscript, respectively. Results from configurations (2), (3) and (4) are all based on the same set of data. Configurations (3) and (4) consist in rejecting some of the data of configuration (2) for calculating the relevant statistics of interest in Complete Blood Counts.

FR-FCM-Z3YB,FR-FCM-Z3YB,3115,Induced psoriasis-like inflammation in an air pouch mouse model (2nd part),"Human psoriasis is a complex autoimmune skin disease, affecting a remarkable percentage of the global population. The initiation pathway comprises the differentiation and infiltration of Th17 cells into the skin and is characterized by the production of IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines among others. This results in a downstream cascade of events, including neutrophil infiltration and an exacerbated inflammatory response. In order to investigate more simplified mechanistic mouse models of psoriasis inflammation, we utilized the 6-day air pouch mouse model and aimed for the induction of a psoriasis-like inflammation by injecting a cocktail of inflammatory triggers into the air pouch cavity. The combination of anti-CD3, IL-23 with or without IL-1? resulted in significantly increased IL-17A and IL-17F intra-pouch levels, triggering a downstream production of the CXCL1 chemokine. The produced cytokines were detectable even 72 hours post-induction. In addition, TCR? was downregulated on the cell surface of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, indicating intra-pouch T cell activation. The presence of anti-CD3 seemed to be important for the increased production of the IL-17 cytokines, even at low concentrations. Furthermore, anti-CD3 induced CD3 positive cell migration into the subcutis and the lining tissue surrounding the air pouch cavity, where in the latter a similar distribution pattern of IL17A expressing cells was also observed. In conclusion, the induced air pouch mouse model can mirror the IL-23/IL-17 axis of psoriasis-like inflammation and is to our knowledge the first published IL-23/IL-17 response established in the air pouch model.","The inflammatory regiment in a moderately viscous medium, consisting of anti-CD3, IL-23 and IL-1β, induced the secretion of IL-17A and IL-17F in the murine 6-day air pouch model and this also triggered the downstream production of CXCL1. Furthermore, anti-CD3 induced T cell activation in the air pouch cavity, shown by downregulation of the TCRαβ receptor. There were no indications of Th17 and Tc17 cell differentiation and accumulation in the air pouch lavage fluid, but the source of IL-17 was speculated to be activated memory Th17 and Tc17 cells or induced γδ T cells. Eventually, more investigations are required to identify the source of the produced IL-17. In addition, the administration of anti-CD3 resulted in CD3+ immune cell infiltration into the subcutis, located underneath the parenchymal cells of dermis, towards the lining tissue of the air pouch cavity. The identity of these cells could be T cells, γδ T cells and others (i.e. iNKTs), but more markers are required to fully characterize them. To our knowledge this is the first Th17 response established in the air pouch model. In conclusion, the induced 6-day air pouch mouse model mirrors the IL-23/IL-17 axis of a psoriasis-like inflammation in regard to the cytokine secretion and the inflammatory reaction and thus this model has the potential to be used in drug discovery when targeting the Th17 inflammatory response","Cells from lavage fluid were characterized by flow cytometry.

In conclusion, the induced air pouch mouse model can mirror the IL-23/IL-17 axis of psoriasis-like inflammation and is to our knowledge the first published IL-23/IL-17 response established in the air pouch model.","The inflammatory regiment in a moderately viscous medium, consisting of anti-CD3, IL-23 and IL-1β, induced the secretion of IL-17A and IL-17F in the murine 6-day air pouch model and this also triggered the downstream production of CXCL1.
                    Furthermore, anti-CD3 induced T cell activation in the air pouch cavity, shown by downregulation of the TCRαβ receptor. There were no indications of Th17 and Tc17 cell differentiation and accumulation in the air pouch lavage fluid, but the source of IL-17 was speculated to be activated memory Th17 and Tc17 cells or induced γδ T cells. Eventually, more investigations are required to identify the source of the produced IL-17.
                    In addition, the administration of anti-CD3 resulted in CD3+ immune cell infiltration into the subcutis, located underneath the parenchymal cells of dermis, towards the lining tissue of the air pouch cavity. The identity of these cells could be T cells, γδ T cells and others (i.e. iNKTs), but more markers are required to fully characterize them. To our knowledge this is the first Th17 response established in the air pouch model.
                    In conclusion, the induced 6-day air pouch mouse model mirrors the IL-23/IL-17 axis of a psoriasis-like inflammation in regard to the cytokine secretion and the inflammatory reaction and thus this model has the potential to be used in drug discovery when targeting the Th17 inflammatory response.","Cells from lavage fluid were characterized by flow cytometry.

Herein we evaluated micro- and nanoplastic particles that can be released from face mask once subject to environmental conditions. Exposure to simulated-low shear forces demonstrated to be effective in breaking and fragmenting face mask tissue into smaller debris. Even at low shear energy densities, a single mask could release in water thousands of microplastic fibers and up to 10^10 submicrometric particles. The latter were quantified using flow cytometry that was proven to be a promising technique for nanoplastic counting, thus improving our understanding on distribution and fate of NPs still representing a great analytical challenge in plastic pollution research.","By mimicking conditions of weathering under realistic intensity levels of mechanical deterioration, our experimental results revealed that a consistent high number of micro/nanoplastics can be promptly released from a single mask, despite low level of fabric deterioration (1.2 ± 1.3% of the initial weight). Flow cytometry was successfully applied to quantify the generation of spherical submicrometric particles from discarded face mask fabrics, at values (2.1 ± 1.4 × 10^10 items/mask) notably higher than those found for microplastics ( > 100 µm) by microscopy (1.2 ± 1.07 × 10^4 items/mask).

Importantly, a direct comparison between VAC069A and VAC069B showed that T cell activation was reduced within these three volunteers by 25-50% in second (compared to first) infection. The lower levels of activation were particularly evident amongst conventional CD4 T cells and to a lesser extent innate-like T cells (e.g. gamma delta and MAIT cells). These data are analogous to our findings in a rechallenge model of falciparum malaria (flowrepository.org experiment number FR-FCM-Z464), which show that T cell activation is attenuated upon reinfection despite an identical pathogen load.","Staining and acquisition was performed at the MRC Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine in Oxford, UK, in collaboration with Michalina Mazurczyk and Giorgio Napolitani. CyTOF was used to resolve changes in the peripheral T cell pool through time in five volunteers (named v02, v05, v07, v11, v21). Demographic information of this cohort is shown in a spreadsheet attached to this experiment. Each volunteer was sampled at four timepoints: C-1 (one day before infection), DoD (day of diagnosis, immediately before treatment), ep6 (six days post-treatment) and C56, 56 days post challenge (~40 days post treatment). The filename contains both the timepoint and individual from whom the sample 
                    was taken. FCS files were generated, followed by bead normalisation and debarcoding using CyTOF software (version 6.7, Fluidigm). All following analyses were carried out in R. T cells were gated by first performing flowSOM clustering to export CD45+CD3+ clusters from whole blood followed by singlet gating using openCyto yielding a Ir191+Ir193+Ce140- population. These singlet T cells were taken forward for CATALYST/flowSOM/diffcyt workflow described in Nowicka et al. (2019 F1000 Research). FlowSOM metaclustering was used to classify T cells into unique subsets. This repository contains fcs files that have been pregated on CD45+CD3+ singlet T cells. Ungated whole blood will shortly be uploaded to a separate experiment.

FR-FCM-Z47Z,FR-FCM-Z47Z,4320,Mapping T cell activation and differentiation in falciparum malaria across the first three infections of life,"Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the majority of deaths associated with malaria. Naïve hosts are most susceptible to life-threatening disease but the risk of severe malaria rapidly declines in endemic settings (often after just one or two infections). What mediates this initial susceptibility and subsequent protection is not understood but appears independent of parasite density, suggesting a host-mediated mechanism. We recently developed a human rechallenge model of falciparum malaria to track the host response to the first three infections of life. In this way, we could examine host adaptations that might provide protection against severe malaria. In this experiment, we present CyTOF data exploring the T cell response to a first-in-life P. falciparum infection (three volunteers - v313, v315, v320) versus rechallenge (third infection, six volunteers - v301, v304, v305, v306, v308, v310). All volunteers were drug-treated at the same parasite density (approx. 10,000 parasites per ml). Note that time-matched RNA-sequencing data from whole blood and flow-sorted T cell subsets are also available from this volunteer cohort (NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus superseries accession no. GSE172481).","Infection of naïve and malaria-experienced hosts led to significant lymphopenia, which fully resolved within six days of drug treatment (and parasite clearance). At this timepoint, a first-in-life infection led to massive T cell activation across all lineages (including diverse CD4, CD8, gamma delta, MAIT and regulatory T cells) culminating in 20-40% of the peripheral T cell pool exhibiting an activated (CD38hi Bcl2lo) phenotype. Surprisingly, this response included features of T cell activation previously associated with tissue pathology in autoimmunity and exceeded the already high levels of T cell activation during a first-in-life P. vivax infection (see https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.21252810). Despite comparable levels of lymphopenia in third infection only 10% of peripheral T cells were activated after parasite clearance (range 5.2-14.5%). This attenuated response was evident in all T cell lineages but was particularly pronounced in conventional CD4 T cells. Significantly, phenotypes associated with tissue damage were essentially absent upon reinfection. Parasite density was identical in first and third infection, ruling out a difference inantigen load as an explanation for this rapid change in T cell activation. Furthermore, parameters of systemic inflammation (inc. plasma proteins and whole blood RNA-sequencing) revealed no change in myeloid cell activation. These data suggest that changes intrinsic to T cells or the tissue niche to which they are recruited must be responsible for the attenuation of T cell activation in malaria-experienced hosts.","Staining and acquisition was performed at the MRC Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine in Oxford, UK, in collaboration with Michalina Mazurczyk and Giorgio Napolitani. CyTOF was used to resolve changes in the peripheral T cell pool through time in eight volunteers (named v301, v304, v305, v306, v308, v310, v313, v315, v320). Demographic information of this cohort is shown in a spreadsheet attached to this experiment. Each volunteer was sampled at four timepoints: baseline (one day before infection), DoD (day of diagnosis, immediately before treatment), T6 (six days post-treatment) and C45, 45 days post challenge (~30 days post treatment). The filename contains both the timepoint and individual from whom the sample was taken (the prefix ""vac63c"" present in some files can be safely ignored, but should be removed when using the supplied metadata for import into a SingleCellExperiment, for example). FCS files were generated using CyTOF software (version 6.7, Fluidigm). Singlet T cells were were gated using Cytobank, all further processing and analysis was carried out in R. Bead normalisation (Finck et al., 2013 Cytometry Part A), debarcoding (Zunder et al., 2015 Nature Protocols) and compensation (non-negative least-squares (NNLS) Chevrier et al., 2018 Cell Systems) were performed using the CATALYST workflow described in Nowicka et al. (209 F1000 Research). https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CATALYST.html
                    
                    FlowSOM metaclustering and manual merging were used to classify T cells into unique subsets.

Here, different CD45 tagging strategies (5-choose-2, 6-choose-3) were compared for tag induced batch effects, signal variance, comparability to individually acquired samples and also in a real-life immunology setting (activated PBMCs from n=20 donors vs naive).","Here, we developed a barcoding protocol taking advantage of the increased resolution and minimized fluorochrome readout interference of full-spectrum flow cytometry. We present the development of a complex 21-colour immunophenotyping assay for up to 20 different samples analysed simultaneously. We show that the resolution of relatively rare T cell subsets is reproducible in samples from the same donor analysed conventionally or post-de-multiplexing. We did not detect multiplexing related batch effects when comparable appropriate fluorescence-minus controls were included in the protocol. The variance between repeated single-tube acquisition and post-de-multiplexing was comparable for lymphoid cell populations, and the method can be used for the simultaneous analysis of samples from the same or different donors. Finally, barcoding offers great potential in parallelising the analysis of complex samples where high inter-sample variability or rare populations are expected, such as immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) challenged with an immunostimulant. Consequently, in order to assess activation induced effects on peripheral T cell phenotypes in a setting mimicking polyclonal, antigen-presenting cell induced T cell activation, we applied our assay protocol comparing superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) challenged cells from n=20 healthy donors in a multiplexed fashion. SEB mediated T cell activation is occasionally used for PD biomarker purposes char but so far has not extensively studied with regards to phenotypic immune cell changes at the population level. Our final workflow included barcoding and pooled immunophenotyping followed by machine learning aided single-cell data analysis to identify SEB driven changes in PBMC lineage composition with a special focus on T cell subsets. As a result, we identified 2 clusters of activated CD4+ T cells emerging exclusively upon superantigen challenge. These clusters would have been challenging to identify using conventional, non-multiplexed approaches as they were virtually absent in treatment-naïve cells, variable between donors and might hence be overlooked using manual gating strategies. Conclusively, we present a novel technique allowing the barcoded acquisition and analysis of PBMCs from up to 20 different donors and activation statuses and present a valid basis for the future development of complex immunophenotyping protocols.",This dataset accompanies our article submission to Cytometry Part A.,[human PBMCs][fluorescent cell barcoding][spectral flow cytometry][T cell assay],,,,,62,Fabian Junker,Fabian Junker,Fabian Junker,2020-02-04 - 2020-08-19,2020-02-04,2020-08-19,2021-09-01,2021-12-01,"F.

In comparison, PST was associated with reduced frequency of CD45RA+CCR7+ naive CD4 T cells and increased frequency of plasmacytoid DCs compared with healthy infants. Functional analysis of intracellular cytokine production following PMA/ionomycin stimulation revealed increased global expression of TNFα across all single cells in PA infants and increased IL-2 expression in the naive CD4 T-cell cluster in PST infants. In addition, investigation of the peanut-specific T-cell response by expression of CD40L and CD69 on CD4 T cells following peanut stimulation revealed that PA, but not PST, is characterized by increases in peanut-activated CD4 T cells that display a memory phenotype.",,[allergy][mass cytometry][immunology],[32107388],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32107388, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351974","[Conditions = PMA(36), PN(35), US(36)], [Sample Type = Non Allergic(36), Peanut Allergic(35), Peanut Sensitised Tolerance(36)]",107,31,MELANIE NEELAND,MELANIE NEELAND,MELANIE NEELAND,2017-04-01 - 2017-06-30,2017-04-01,2017-06-30,2021-10-01,2021-11-01,"Stanford University, Palo Alto,  (United States)",Sean N.

FR-FCM-Z4N2,FR-FCM-Z4N2,4834,Bystander CD4+ T cells infiltrate human tumors and are phenotypically distinct,"Tumor-specific T cells likely underpin effective immune checkpoint-blockade therapies. Yet, most studies focus on Treg cells and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here we study CD4+ TILs in human lung and colorectal cancers and observe that non-Treg CD4+ TILs average more than 70% of total CD4+ TILs in both cancer types. Leveraging high dimensional analyses including mass cytometry, we reveal that CD4+ TILs are phenotypically heterogeneous, within each tumor and across patients. Consistently, we find different subsets of CD4+ TILs showing characteristics of effectors, tissue resident memory (Trm) or exhausted cells (expressing PD-1, CTLA-4 and CD39). In both cancer types, the frequencies of CD39? non-Treg CD4+ TILs strongly correlate with frequencies of CD39? CD8+ TILs, which we and others have previously shown to be enriched for cells specific for cancer-unrelated antigens (bystanders). Ex-vivo, we demonstrate that CD39? CD4+ TILs can be specific for cancer unrelated antigens, such as HCMV epitopes.","Overall, our findings highlight that CD4+ TILs can also recognize cancer-unrelated antigens and suggest measuring CD39 expression as a straightforward way to quantify or isolate bystander CD4+ T cells.",,,,,,,20,yannick SIMONI,yannick SIMONI,yannick SIMONI,2021-11-05 - 2021-11-06,2021-11-05,2021-11-06,2021-11-01,2021-11-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,,,1552.753,19.409,80,323.529,4.044,FCS2.0(80),"DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-6.7.1014(54), DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-6.0.626(26)"

FR-FCM-Z4NS,FR-FCM-Z4NS,4860,Coordinated glucocorticoid receptor and MAFB action induces tolerogenesis and epigenome remodelling in dendritic cells,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dendritic cells (DCs), central actors for coordinating immune responses, acquire tolerogenic properties in response to GCs. Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) have emerged as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases. To date, the underlying cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms orchestrating GC-mediated acquisition of immunosuppressive properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic remodeling associated with differentiation to DCs in the presence of GCs. Our analysis demonstrates a major role of MAFB in this process, in synergy with GR. GR and MAFB both interact with methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 and bind to genomic loci that undergo specific demethylation in tolDCs. We also show that the role of MAFB is more extensive, binding to thousands of genomic loci in tolDCs. Finally, MAFB knockdown erases the tolerogenic properties of tolDCs and reverts the specific DNA demethylation and gene upregulation. The preeminent role of MAFB is also demonstrated in vivo for myeloid cells from synovium in rheumatoid arthritis following GC treatment. Our results imply that, once directly activated by GR, MAFB plays a critical role in orchestrating the epigenomic and transcriptomic remodeling that define the tolerogenic phenotype.",Conclusions and detailed explanation regarding the methodology are explained in the manuscript.,,[inflammation][dendritic cells][glucocorticoid receptor][MAFB][epigenetics][tolerogenesis],,,,,50,Octavio Morante-Palacios,Esteban Ballestar,Octavio Morante-Palacios,2021-11-12 - 2021-11-12,2021-11-12,2021-11-12,2021-11-01,2021-11-01,"Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona,  (Catalonia, Spain)","We thank the CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya and the Josep Carreras Foundation for institutional support.

Circulating platelets are heterogeneous in size, age, receptor expression, and reactivity. They inherit many features from megakaryocytes and are further modified on exposure to bioactive substances in the bloodstream. Among these substances, prothrombotic agonists, vasodilators, and bloodborne pathogens modulate platelet phenotypes via distinct signaling cascades. The ability of platelets to respond to (patho)physiologic signals is incompletely understood but likely depends on their repertoire of surface receptors, which may partition them into discrete subsets with specialized functions and divergent abilities. The single-cell resolution of flow and mass cytometry is ideal for immunophenotyping and allows the identification of platelet subsets in remarkable detail.

                    CyTOF was employed in a single batch to characterize the expression of 39 surface and intracellular proteins using a custom antibody panel (Supplementary Table 2). Blood and synovial fluid samples were washed and stained with metal-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. For all stains, viability staining by cisplatin was added to plated cells for 10 min before staining. After washing and centrifugation, Fc-Block reagent was added for 10 min before adding cell-surface CyTOF antibody staining cocktails. Cells were stained for 30 minutes, then washed once in CyTOF staining buffer (CSB, calcium/magnesium-free PBS, 0.2% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide). Cells were ﬁxed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS (PFA) for 10 minutes, washed by centrifugation, then permeabilized with eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer (Life Technologies # 00-5523-00) for sample barcoding with palladium reagents as described [10]. After barcoding, cells were washed by centrifugation, combined into a single tube, fixed with Fix/Perm buffer, then washed once in permeabilization buffer. The intracellular CyTOF antibody staining cocktail (antibodies against PR3, Nrf2, Arginase 1, OLFM4, Elastase, Defensin 3, LL-37 and MPO) was diluted in permeabilization buffer to stain cells for 1 hour. Cells were washed in CSB by centrifugation, then fixed overnight in 1.6% PFA. Prior to acquisition, iridium-intercalator solution (MaxPar Intercalator-Ir 500 mM; Fluidigm Sciences) was added to cells in PBS. After washing by centrifugation, cells were diluted in Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS, Fluidigm Sciences) at a concentration of 7.5 x 105 cells/ml with addition of EQ calibration beads (EQ Four Element Calibration Beads; Fluidigm Sciences) to normalize metal intensity signals using the manufacturer’s protocol.

                    Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo version 10.7.1 and R. During initial quality control, contaminating leukocytes were removed (Supplementary Figure 2). We retained 280,174 single neutrophils from a total of 33 samples in our dataset. These comprised 119,354 neutrophils from healthy control blood, 94,771 neutrophils from blood of patients with inflammatory arthritis, and 66,049 neutrophils from inflamed synovial fluid. We extracted mean signal intensities for each channel per sample and calculated Spearman correlation coefficients between samples as with the RNAseq data. Using these mean expression values, fold changes were calculated and log2 transformed. For marker expression between groups, multiple t-tests were performed and p-values adjusted using Holm correction. For marker-to-marker correlation analysis, intensity on the bulk level was defined as the mean intensity of each marker from all the cells in each sample and on the single cell level, each cell was considered separately. For analysis on the single-cell level, UMAP dimensionality reduction was performed with standard settings, using all antigens (Supplementary Figures 2 and 4) or all antigens minus OLFM4, CD177 and PR3 (all other Figures) as input. Neutrophils were intentionally overclustered into k = 20 clusters.

In flow cytometric studies, the presence of AF can lead to reduced antigen and population resolution, as well as the presence of artifacts due to false positive events. Here, we describe a methodology that uses the inherent ability of full spectrum cytometry to treat AF as a fluorochrome and to thereby separate it from the other fluorochromes of the assay. This method can be applied to complex inflamed tissues; for instance, in regenerating skeletal muscles we have developed a 16-color panel targeting highly autofluorescent myeloid cells.

Therefore, we investigated whether using manually placed rectangular gates and predefined gating thresholds based on fluorescence intensities produced similar results as compared to placing polygonal gates.","Placement of rectangular gates decreases the likelihood of including Ki-67 negative cells, as the gating threshold does not differ for the individual populations. Therefore, placing rectangular gates results in less inter-observer variability and more sensitively detection of differences between non-clonal cytopenic patients and MDS patients. Differences diminished by the use of predefined gating thresholds based on the fluorescent intensity of the Ki-67 staining. By using predefined gating thresholds, the intensity of the Ki-67 staining becomes a confounder in analyzing the Ki-67 proliferation indices and is influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include among others inter-operator variations, antibody batch variations and differences in staining intensities between the non-clonal cytopenic patient group and MDS patient group.

Using single-cell proteomics by mass cytometry, we find disrupted regulation of humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients, with a sex-biased loss of circulating follicular regulatory T cells (cTfr) at a significantly greater rate in male patients. In addition, a male sex-associated cellular network of T-peripheral helper, plasma blasts, proliferating and extrafollicular/atypical CD11c+
                     memory B cells was strongly positively correlated with neutralizing antibody concentrations and negatively correlated with cTfr frequency. These results suggest that sex-specific differences to the balance of cTfr and a network of extrafollicular antibody production-associated cell types may be a key factor in the altered humoral immune responses between male and female COVID-19 patients.","Dataset was published in 10.1073/pnas.2217902120

                    Description of experiments: Primary CD4+ T cells isolated from buffy coats of healthy volunteers were treated with 10uM of iberdomide, 500nM of JQ1, or both compounds, with PMA/ionomycin used as a positive control. The cells were examined by flow-cytometry at 24 and 48 hours, live cells were gated using forward scatter area versus side scatter area profiles (FSC-A, SSC-A). Cells were then stained for expression of Annexin V to examine the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis and with the surface receptor CD69 to measure T cells activation. For Annexin V and CD69 staining, 106 cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and 2.5 mM CaCl2 followed by staining with Annexin V-PE (Becton and Dickinson), CD69-FITC (eBIOSCIENCE) for 20 minutes at 4C in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl2. Cells were then washed with PBS/FBS/CaCl2 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Between 2 - 4x105 events were collected per sample within 3 hours after staining on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, 4 lasers, 18 parameters) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.7.4, Tree Star). To analyze T cell proliferation capacity, 1 million CD8+ or CD4+ T cells were stained with 0,07 uM CellTrace Far Red Cell Proliferation dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer?s instructions. Cells were then cultivated for 72 hours with either unstimulated or stimulated conditions in the presence of the LRA, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Stimulation of T cells was performed using Anti-CD3/CD28 coated Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer?s protocol. Proliferation capacity was determined by a decrease in proliferation dye intensity in daughter cells upon cell division. To analyze T cell functionality by means of cytokine expression 1 million CD8+ or CD4+ T cells were left untreated or treated with the LRA for 18 hours. Cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/mL PMA and 1uM Ionomycin for 7 hours in the presence of a protein transport inhibitor (BD GolgiPlugTM, BD Biosciences).  To stain for intracellular cytokines cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS followed by a fixation and permeabilization step with FIX & PERM Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer?s protocol and incubated with 1:25 BV510 anti-IL2 (563265, BD Biosciences) and PE-Cy7 anti-IFNg (27-7319-41, eBioscience) in permeabilization buffer for 45 minutes at 4C. Stained cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.
                    
                    To analyze production of viral RNA by FISH-Flow, cells were collected, fixed, permeabilised and subjected to the PrimeFlow RNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer?s instructions and as described in (Rao, 2021, Nat Comm)(21). Primary CD4+ T cells were first stained in Fixable Viability dye 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 minutes at room temperature (1:1000 in dPBS). HIV unspliced mRNA was thenlabelled with a set of 40 probe pairs against the GagPol region of the vRNA (catalogue number GagPol HIV-1 VF10-10884, Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:5 in diluent provided in the kit and hybridized to the target mRNA for 2 hours at 40°C. Samples were washed to remove excess probes and stored overnight in the presence of RNAsin. Signal amplification was then performed by sequential 1.5 hours, 40°C incubations with the pre-amplification and amplification mix.

They are the most abundant organisms and represent one of the biggest sources of unknown biodiversity. Viruses also have an important impact on bacterial and algal mortality in the ocean, and as such have a major influence on microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known about the abundance and distribution patterns of viruses across the oceans and seas. Over the last 20 years, flow cytometry has been the technique of choice to detect and count the viral particles in natural samples. Nevertheless, due to their small size, the detection of marine viruses is still extremely challenging. In this article we describe how a new generation of flow cytometer which uses the side scatter (SSC) of violet photons from a 405 nm laser beam helps to improve the resolution for detecting marine viruses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where virioplankton has been detected in aquatic samples using flow cytometry with a 405 nm violet SSC instead of a 488 nm blue SSC.",None,,[SYBR Green I][Virus like particles][405 nm side scatter][sub-clusters],,,,,40,Yuan ZHAO,Yuan ZHAO,Yuan ZHAO,2017-11-08 -,2017-11-08,,2022-04-01,2022-04-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,,,11132.811,236.868,47,1104.543,23.501,FCS3.0(47),CytoFLEX(47)

The selected enzyme fused to the signal peptide library was the alpha-amylase from B. amyloliquefaciens and the host strain was B. subtilis. Secretion levels were indirectly assessed via the measurement of amylase activity in each NLR. This was possible via the encapsulation of each clone with a defined amount of fluorescein-labelled starch. Being a hydrogel-based system, the porosity of the NLRs matrix allowed the diffusion of low molecular weight hydrolyzed products out of the bead, reducing the overall fluorescence of the bead. In fact secretion of the amylase inversely correlated with the fluorescence of the NLR. Activity was normalized by biomass using Nile red (red fluorescent dye) to stain the embedded cells.

Flow cytometry is an essential and efficient approach for the analysis of the cell cycle in yeast, and refining the cell cycle resolution is important. However, the resolution refinement is possibly subject to multiple factors, including altered enzymatic treatment and medium variation, which had been seldomly investigated. In this study, flow cytometry combined with multiple enzymatic treatments and various media are performed to determine how this resolution is affected. We show that the resolution is significantly altered under multiple enzymatic conditions. In addition, various media also results in the fluctuation in the resolution. Therefore, different enzymes are confirmed to refine the resolution with varied efficiencies, which is suspicious of due to the alternated culture media with different amino nitrogen concentrations, impacting the protein content in the yeast cell wall, and leading to the changed permeability of cell wall and the variable resolution. This study provides beneficial technical information about the influences of the adjustments of media and enzymes on refining the cell cycle resolution of yeast and, probably, on other fungi, which should be included in the consideration in future research.",[cell cycle][SYBR Green I][Saccharomyces cerevisiae][Yeast][High Resolution Flow cytometry][performance][flow cytomery],,,,,47,Zhongkai Gu,Zhongkai Gu,Zhongkai Gu,2021-03-01 - 2022-02-01,2021-03-01,2022-02-01,2022-04-01,2022-04-01,None,This study is personally funded.,No gating was setup.

FR-FCM-Z596,FR-FCM-Z596,5414,P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/CD162) is incorporated into clinical HIV-1 isolates and can mediate virus capture and subsequent transfer to permissive cells.,"                    Background: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/CD162) has been studied extensively for its role in mediating leukocyte rolling through interactions with its cognate receptor, P-selectin. Recently, PSGL-1 was identified as a novel HIV-1 host restriction factor, particularly when expressed at high levels in the HIV envelope. Importantly, while the potent antiviral activity of PSGL-1 has been clearly demonstrated in various complementary model systems, the breadth of PSGL-1 incorporation across genetically diverse viral isolates and clinical isolates has yet to be described. Additionally, the biological activity of virion-incorporated PSGL-1 has also yet to be shown. 
                    Results: Herein we assessed the levels of PSGL-1 on viruses produced through transfection with various amounts of PSGL-1 plasmid DNA (0-250 ng), compared to levels of PSGL-1 on viruses produced through infection of T cell lines and primary PBMC. We found that very low levels of PSGL-1 plasmid DNA (< 2.5 ng/well) were necessary to generate virus models that could closely mirror the phenotype of viruses produced via infection of T cells and PBMC. Unique to this study, we show that PSGL-1 is incorporated in a broad range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates and that virions with incorporated PSGL-1 are detectable in plasma from viremic HIV-1-infected individuals, corroborating the relevance of PSGL-1 in natural infection. Additionally, we show that PSGL-1 on viruses can bind its cognate selectin receptors, P-, E-, and L-selectins. Finally, we show viruses with endogenous levels of PSGL-1 can be captured by P-selectin and transferred to HIV-permissive bystander cells, highlighting a novel role for PSGL-1 in HIV-1 infection. Notably, viruses engineered to overexpress PSGL-1 were noninfectious in our hands, in line with previous findings reporting the potent antiviral activity of PSGL-1.
                  ","Our results indicate that levels of PSGL-1 incorporation into virions can vary widely among model systems tested, and that careful tailoring of plasmid levels is required to recapitulate physiological systems when using pseudovirus models. Taken together, our data suggest that PSGL-1 may play diverse roles in the physiology of HIV-1 infection, particularly due to the functionally active state of PSGL-1 on virion surfaces and the breadth of PSGL-1 incorporation among a wide range of viral isolates.",,[gp120][P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/CD162)][P-selectin (CD62P)][human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)][HIV-1 infection][HIV-1 envelope][HIV-1 restriction factors][virion-incorporated proteins][virion capture][calibrated flow virometry],[35597982],http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35597982,,,36,Jonathan Burnie,Christina Guzzo,Jonathan Burnie,2020-04-01 - 2022-04-21,2020-04-01,2022-04-21,2022-04-01,2022-05-01,"University of Toronto Scarborough,  University of Toronto Scarborough, Scarborough, Canada,  (Canada)",Not disclosed,MESF Beads were used for fluorescence standardization.

                    second situation has been scarcely investigated up to now. Very little information is available about the ultrasound
                    effects on healthy red blood cells and lymphocytes. Here, we evaluated. in vitro. the bio-effects of the low-energy
                    ultrasounds on red blood cells and PBMCs isolated from healthy donors as well as on two myeloid leukemia cell lines
                    (OCI-AML-3 and MOLM-13) and lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell line (Jurkat). We analyzed different parameters, such as
                    vitality, proliferation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of specific markers on healthy lymphocytes as
                    well as the vitality of RBCs and leukemia cell lines. Our data show that ultrasound treatment induces typical apoptotic
                    alterations in leukemia cells, including alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential, loss of phosphatidylserine
                    asymmetry, morphological changes, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overall, we demonstrated that
                    lymphocytes vitality, proliferation/activation and cytotoxic functions are fully preserved after ultrasound treatment, on

                    Phytoplankton groups were enumerated using a BD Influx flow cytometer equipped with a forward scatter (FSC) detector with small particle option (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Crocosphaera and pigmented eukaryotes (<5-µm (1)) were enumerated in unstained samples following published protocols (2). Briefly, cells were identified based on red fluorescence signals vs FSC, then further gated by FSC and orange fluorescence. The high phycoerythrin (orange) signal in Synechococcus and Crocosphaera was used to distinguish them from Prochlorococcus and pigmented eukaryotes. A 488 plus a 457 nm (200 and 300 mW solid state, respectively) laser focused into the same pinhole resolved dim surface Prochlorococcus population from background noise in a FSC vs red fluorescence plot. Potential particle aggregates were discarded using a pulse width vs. forward scatter plot. Calibration and alignment were done using 1-μm yellow-green microspheres (Polysciences, USA).

FR-FCM-Z5Y3,FR-FCM-Z5Y3,5155,Mod(mdg4)_Reporter_HETRP,"                    Telomeres in Drosophila are composed of sequential non-LTR retrotransposons: HeTA,
                    TART, and TAHRE. Although they are repressed by the piRNA pathway in the
                    germline, how these retrotransposons are regulated in somatic cells is poorly
                    understood. Here, we show that specific splice variants of Mod(mdg4) repress HeT-A
                    by blocking subtelomeric enhancers in ovarian somatic cells. We found that the
                    Mod(mdg4)-N variant represses HeT-A expression most efficiently among the variants.
                    Mod(mdg4)-N mutant flies show elevated HeT-A expression and female sterility.
                    Mod(mdg4)-N-binding subtelomeric sequences exhibit enhancer-blocking activity, and
                    recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on subtelomeres by Mod(mdg4)-N is
                    essential for this enhancer-blocking. Moreover, Mod(mdg4)-N functions to form
                    chromatin boundaries of higher-order chromatin conformation but this mechanism is
                    independent of its Pol II recruitment activity at telomeres/subtelomeres. This study
                    provides a link between enhancer-blocking and telomere regulation, and two different

FR-FCM-Z5YT,FR-FCM-Z5YT,5181,Early response evaluation in AML,"                    Background: A fundamental hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to sustain proliferative signaling and cell survival, reflected in a cellular chemotherapy response that is poorly understood. We questioned whether chemotherapy modulated phospho-signaling at 4 and 24 h in vivo could provide information about long-term survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and if the signaling response to therapy was more informative than analysis at time of diagnosis. 
                    Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 32 younger AML patients (age 16-74 years), before, 4- and 24 hours after start of induction chemotherapy. Samples were analyzed by 36-dimensional mass cytometry for assessment of alterations in immunophenotypes and intracellular signaling using unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches. Results were validated by RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics (Super SILAC). Targeted sequencing was used to characterize patient samples for recurrent AML mutations. Drug sensitivity and resistance testing ex vivo was compared to activation of relevant signal transduction pathways and mutational profile.  
                    Findings: 5-year patient survival was accurately predicted in the leukemic cell population at 24 hours after therapy onset by phospho-proteins p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) and p-p38 (T180/Y182). RNA sequencing showed induction of MAPK target gene expression and the AP-1 transcription complex in patients with high p-ERK1/2. Super-SILAC proteomics confirmed an increase in the abundance of p38 prime target MAPKAPK2(MK2) 24 hours after start of induction therapy. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing demonstrated high sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in the patient cells with high p-ERK1/2 measured at diagnosis or 24 hours after start of chemotherapy. 
                    Interpretation: Early single cell signaling response to chemotherapy provided precise prognostic information independent of stratification by genetics. We propose that early functional measurement of chemotherapy-potentiated MAPK pathway signaling could identify non-responders to intensive chemotherapy allowing precise treatment adjustment.

                    Background
                    The search for immune correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in humans is limited by the focus on peripheral blood measures. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can safely be done and provides insight into cellular function in the lung where infection is first established. In this study, blood and lung samples were assayed to determine if heavily MTB exposed persons who resist development of latent MTB infection (RSTR) vs those who develop latent MTB infection (LTBI), differ in the make-up of resident BAL innate and adaptive immune cells.
                    
                    Methods
                    Bronchoscopy was performed on 21 healthy long-term Ugandan RSTR and 25 LTBI participants. Immune cell distributions in BAL and peripheral blood were compared by differential cell counting and flow cytometry.
                    
                    Results
                    The bronchoscopy procedure was well tolerated with few adverse reactions. Differential macrophage and lymphocyte frequencies in BAL differed between RSTR and LTBI. When corrected for age, this difference lost statistical significance. BAL CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were almost entirely composed of effector memory T cells in contrast to PBMC, and did not differ between RSTR and LTBI. BAL NKT, ?? T cells and NK cells also did not differ between RTSR and LTBI participants. There was a marginally significant increase (p = 0.034) in CD8 T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) in PBMC of LTBI vs RSTR participants.
                    
                    Conclusion
                    This observational case-control study comparing unstimulated BAL from RSTR vs LTBI, did not find evidence of large differences in the distribution of baseline BAL immune cells. PBMC TEMRA cell percentage was higher in LTBI relative to RSTR suggesting a role in the maintenance of latent MTB infection. Functional immune studies are required to determine if and how RSTR and LTBI BAL immune cells differ in response to MTB.

Markers present in the OMIP allow the profiling of neutrophil subsets associated with ontogeny, migration, phagocytosis capacity, granule release, and immune modulation. For panel design, we ensured that the commonly available fluorophores FITC/AF488 and PE were assigned to the intracellular subset marker Olfactomedin 4 and maturity marker CD10 respectively. These markers can be easily replaced without affecting core identification of neutrophils, enabling antibodies to new neutrophil antigens of interest or for fluorescent substrates to assess different neutrophil functions to be easily explored. Panel optimisation was performed on whole blood and purified neutrophils. We demonstrate applications on clinical samples (whole blood) and experimental endpoints (purified neutrophils stimulated through an in vitro transmigration assay). We hope that providing a uniform platform to analyse neutrophil plasticity in various sample types will facilitate the future understanding of neutrophil subsets in health and disease.",The flexible application of this panel combined with the capability for widespread adaptation to different human samples will drive much needed contextualisation of neutrophil subsets in human health and disease.,"FCS files are for three experiments: FMOs, Migration experiment and saliva experiment.

FR-FCM-Z6AG,FR-FCM-Z6AG,6480,The validation of hPxt1 in vitro function in apoptosis,"[Figure 5A] As Pxt1 BH3 was verified to activate the liposome-permeabilizing ability of recombinant Bak, we subsequently investigated the effects of the expression of full-length Pxt1 constructs on the cellular condition of the mitochondria. Therefore, we investigated whether Pxt1 expression causes loss of ??m and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, the two representative consequences of Bak activation in the mitochondria reflecting the progression of MOMP. First, the ratio of active mitochondria in HeLa cells was measured by flow cytometry using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a cationic dye that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix and is used as a ??m indicator. [Figure 6D-F and S8] The fate of human or mouse Pxt1-expressing HeLa cells was further analyzed using flow cytometry that determines the rate of apoptosis. [Figure 7A and 8B] We investigated the functional significance of Bak in Pxt1-induced MOMP and apoptosis. To this end, Bax-deficient (Bax-/-) HeLa cell lines were generated using CRISPR. Genetic suppression of Bak expression was achieved by Bak-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) called siBak. Bax-/- HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA (siNON) or siBak for 48 h, and then followed by transfection with the plasmid expressing control GFP or GFP-tagged human Pxt1.","In this study, we delineated the molecular details and functional consequences of the interaction between Bak and human Pxt1, which was determined to be an effective proapoptotic initiator. Therefore, our work expands our understanding of the regulation of Bak and Bax, the critical executors of MOMP and apoptosis. We speculate that Pxt1 is not unique but is the first case of a noncanonical BH3-only protein activating Bak/Bax. Thus, the identification and molecular characterization of unidentified Bak/Bax-interacting factors would be an interesting topic for future research in this field. We also expect that our research will provide a rational basis for therapeutic approaches, especially those involved in controlling apoptosis that occurs during spermatogenesis.",,[APOPTOSIS][Peroxisomal testis-specific 1][Pxt1][Bak][BH3],,,,,48,So-Hui Choe,Jinho Seo,So-Hui Choe,2021-01-01 - 2023-04-04,2021-01-01,2023-04-04,2023-05-01,2023-05-01,"Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB),  Aging Convergence Research Center, Daejeon,  (Korea)",Not disclosed,None,,,,1000.555,10.532,95,19.532,0.206,FCS3.0(95),BD FACSVerse(95)

However, their identity, abundance, ecological dynamics and biogeochemical impact in aquatic ecosystems remain understudied in comparison to classically demarcated autotrophs or heterotrophs. In this study, we make use of fluorescently labelled prey and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to taxonomically identify actively-feeding individual mixotrophic flagellates from lake water. Replicated experiments were carried out to assess the performance of three different fluorescently labelled prey types and a fluorescent dye targeting food vacuoles. In the experiments, water from an oligotrophic lake was exposed independently to each type of reporter and cells were individually sorted based on fluorescent signals for predation and chlorophyll a.","A total of 927 individual single cells were successfully recovered, with all fluorescent reporters exhibiting high sensitivity for putative mixotrophic taxa: overall, 87% of the occurrences could be assigned to dictyochophytes, 9% to chrysophytes and 3% to dinoflagellates. As a result, we were able to detect cryptic diversity within pedinellid algae and report a Prorocentrum-like freshwater occurrence. We argue that this procedure can be a valuable tool to uncover relevant and unexpected active mixotrophic species in a wider range of aquatic environments, and could easily be coupled to other techniques to describe the finer details of the trophic status of aquatic microbial communities.",,[fluorescently labelled bacteria][mixotrophy][food vacuole staining][single-cell identification],,,,,68,Javier Florenza Garcia,Stefan  Bertilsson,Javier Florenza Garcia,2020-10-22 - 2020-10-22,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,2023-05-01,2023-05-01,"Uppsala University,  Dept. of Ecology and Genetics, Uppsala,  (Sweden)","EU Horizon 2020 (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015-675752), FORMAS (2022-01211), Malménska Studiestiftelsen",None,,,summary_mixocapture.accession.flowrepo.txt,892.202,63.729,14,268.504,19.179,FCS3.0(14),MoFlo Astrios(14)

FR-FCM-Z6L8,FR-FCM-Z6L8,6824,Liston Tissue Treg Nur77 (UbCre MHCIIflox),"                    The purpose of this series of experiments was two-fold:
                    1) Assess TCR activity in tissue-resident Tregs by means of Nur77 staining.
                    2) Assess whether loss of MHCII in all cells (via tamoxifen-inducible Cre under the ubiquitin promoter) would lead to a reduction in Nur77 expression in tissue Tregs, a change in their numbers within tissues or a change in their activation status.
                  ","For the first aim, we conclude that tissue-resident Tregs show engagement of the TCR as determined by the Nur77 proxy. This Nur77 staining is higher in CD69+ (longer residency) Tregs than in CD69- Tregs. This analysis was performed using the WT controls.
                    
                    For the second aim, the results were inconclusive. The loss of MHCII was incomplete and slightly variable from one experiment to the next. In some experiments, we saw the expected outcome of reduced Nur77 and/or CD69 expression, but not consistently across all experiments. MHCII is expressed at such a high level that there is likely considerable protein still around in the absence of new transcription for quite some time.

Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can enhance the anti-tumor immune response from cancer vaccines.  To determine the most effective combination of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination, with or without the adjuvant toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists poly-ICLC or resiquimod, we conducted a randomized, open-label multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival in 23 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent WHO Grade III-IV malignant gliomas.  Patients were randomized to receive ATL-DC vaccination with either a placebo, a TLR-7/8 agonist (resiquimod, topical 0.2%), or a TLR-3 agonist (poly-ICLC, 20 mcg/kg intramuscular).  Peripheral blood was obtained at baseline and following the vaccination cycle for immune monitoring.

FR-FCM-Z6Y6,FR-FCM-Z6Y6,6182,Growth rate and substrate component limitation define the nutritional composition and cell size of microbial biomass intended for food applications ,"The growing world population, along with a shift towards diets richer in animal protein has led to a steep increase in global protein demand. A global shift towards diets richer in plant-based ingredients (i.e. strictly following the recommended meat consumption or flexitarian) would not be sufficient to enable operation within the planetary boundaries, while a global switch to fully vegetarian diets is an unlikely scenario. Microbial biomass from bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi and microalgae, used as food, could be a key solution to enable food security. However, despite the renewed interest in the use of microbial biomass in food, many aspects have been neglected, including changes in nucleic acid composition and amino acid and protein profiles that could impact the properties of the microbial biomass and the processing required to convert it into edible food. The cultivation conditions of microorganisms play a crucial role in determining the composition and size of the cells and, therefore, the nutritional quality of microbial biomass. In addition, the diversity and versatility of microorganisms allow for the adjustment of the nutritional quality and physical and chemical properties of microbial biomass to meet a wide range of food applications. While information on the food properties of microbial biomass is currently limited, there is significant potential for microorganisms to be used as a versatile ingredient in the food industry. It is therefore essential to study and improve the food quality properties of microbial biomass to make it a viable and high-quality alternative to animal proteins. This work is a critical contribution to this field and combines principles of bioprocess engineering, microbiology and cell biology to address this knowledge gap. Microbial biomass has emerged as a promising sustainable protein alternative. The cultivation conditions affect the composition of microbial cells, and hence their quality and nutritional value. Here, we investigated the relationship between growth rate, substrate availability and cell composition and size of Cupriavidus necator and Komagataella phaffii.","Biomass with decreased nucleic acid and increased protein content was produced at low growth rates. Conversely, high rates resulted in larger cells, which could enable more efficient biomass harvesting. The proteome allocation varied across the different growth rates, with more ribosomal proteins at higher rates. Considering the distinct amino acid profiles established for the different cellular components, variations in their abundance impacts the product quality leading to higher cysteine and phenylalanine content at low growth rates. In summary, we demonstrate tradeoffs between nutritional quality and production rate, and we discuss that techno-functional food properties should be considered when designing microbial biomass production processes.",,[growth rate][macromolecular cell composition][microbial food][nucleic acid][protein profile][amino acid profile][nutritional quality][nutrient availability][microbial protein ],[38072930],http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38072930,,,89,Myrsini Sakarika,Frederiek - Maarten Kerckhof,Frederiek - Maarten Kerckhof,2020-11-01 - 2020-12-31,2020-11-01,2020-12-31,2023-01-01,2023-04-01,"Ghent University,  Centre for Microbial Ecology and Technology, Gent,  (Belgium)","M.S. was supported by the Catalisti cluster SBO project CO2PERATE (“All renewable CCU based on formic acid integrated in an industrial microgrid”), with the financial support of VLAIO, Belgium (Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepeneurship).

DCR has been correlated with CAR T cell products enriched with T cell memory phenotypes. Therefore, reagents that consistently promote memory phenotypes during the manufacturing of CAR T cells have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes. A novel modular multi-cytokine particle (MCP) platform is developed that combines the signals necessary for activation, costimulation, and cytokine support into a single ?all-in-one? stimulation reagent for CAR T cell manufacturing. This platform allows for the assembly and screening of compositionally diverse MCP libraries to identify formulations tailored to promote specific phenotypes with a high degree of flexibility. This platform is leveraged to identify unique MCP formulations that manufacture CAR T cells that exhibit increased proportions of memory-like phenotypes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient CAR T cells and demonstrate superior anti-tumor efficacy in mouse models of lymphoma and ovarian cancer through enhanced persistence.

In order to expand the application of alkenyl oxindoles for targeted protein degradation, we designed and synthesized a series of hetero-bifunctional compounds by conjugating different alkenyl oxindoles with bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1. Through structure-activity relationship study, we successfully developed JQ1-alkenyl oxindole conjugates that potently degrade BRD4. Unexpectedly, we found that these molecules degrade BRD4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, rather than the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Using pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening, we revealed that JQ1-alkenyl oxindole conjugates recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4DCAF11 for substrate degradation. Furthermore, we validated the most potent hetero-bifunctional molecule HL435 as a promising drug-like lead compound to exert antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we introduce a no-wash assay based on single-platform cell enumeration and Streptamer staining to determine the Wilms? tumor antigen 1 (WT1)-specific T cell immunity in clinical samples.","The accuracy of the assay was high for all performed experiments. Differences were apparent regarding the limit of detection/quantification (LOD/LOQ). Results obtained for WT1 yielded a notably higher LOD/LOQ than for virus-specific multimers. However, subsequent screening of 22 healthy individuals revealed significantly higher values staining for WT1 than for HIV pol-specific T cells. These differences could not be observed applying a classical wash-protocol.

Immunocompromised mice were injected with preparations of MV4;11 cells and disease progressed until detectable. At that time, mice were treated either with I-BET151 or vehicle control. The presence and degree of disease progression was determined by measuring the number of human leukemia cells present in the peripheral blood (PM), spleen (SPL), and bone marrow (BM) of leukemic xenograft mice. Leukemic mice treated with I-BET151 will be compared to mice treated with vehicle control to determine if I-BET151 treatment increases survival of the mice. Additionally, tumor burden and cell death were monitored to test if I-BET151 decreased tumor burden and increased cell death, compared to vehicle control. This protocol replicates the experiments reported in Figure 4B,D and Supp. Figure 16A of Dawson et al., 2011.","Testing I-BET151 efficacy in a disseminated xenograft MLL mouse model we did not find a statistically significant difference in survival, whereas the original study reported an increase in survival in I-BET151 treated mice compared to vehicle control (Figure 4B,D; Dawson et al., 2011). Monitoring the extent of disease burden in this mouse model, we found I-BET151 treatment resulted in a lower median disease burden compared to vehicle control in all tissues analyzed, similar to the example reported in the original study (Supplementary Figure 16A; Dawson et al., 2011).  Observationally, there was no notable difference in cell death in the peripheral blood or spleen, with a minor decrease in both apoptotic (Annexin V+PI-) and necrotic cells (Annexin V+PI+) observed in the bone marrow of I-BET151 treated mice compared to vehicle control.

Here, we combine two high-dimensional technologies—single-cell messenger RNA sequencing (scmRNAseq) and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF)—to identify human blood CD123+CD33+CD45RA+ DC precursors (pre-DC). Pre-DC share surface markers with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) but have distinct functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Tracing the differentiation of DC from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood revealed that the pre-DC compartment contains distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted CD123high pre-DC subset and two CD45RA+CD123low lineage-committed subsets exhibiting functional differences. The discovery of multiple committed pre-DC populations opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting.","Exported FCS files after bead normalization, debarcoding and selection of live CD45+ cells.",,,,,,20,Evan Newell,Evan Newell,Evan Newell,2017-06-15 -,2017-06-15,,2017-06-01,2017-06-01,"Singapore Immunology Network, Singapore,  (Singapore)",Not disclosed,None,,,,4453.653,1113.413,4,951.427,237.857,"FCS2.0(2), FCS3.0(2)",DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-6.0.626(4)

Systems-level analyses offer increased power to sort patients on the basis of coordinated changes across immune cells and proteins. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a well-established form of immunotherapy whereby a donor immune system induces a graft-versus-leukemia response. This fails when the donor immune system regenerates improperly, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and leukemia relapse. We present a systems-level analysis by mass cytometry and serum profiling in 26 patients sampled 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Using a combination of machine learning and topological data analyses, we show that global immune signatures associated with clinical outcome can be revealed, even when patients are few and heterogeneous. This high-resolution systems immune monitoring approach holds the potential for improving the development and evaluation of immunotherapies in the future.","Highlights:

Cells treated with the method can be fixed for a safe flow cytometry analysis of infected samples or for the comparative analysis of multiple samples in high-throughput settings. This is a potentially useful application of the method, since high-throughput settings could not be planned before for the multi-parametric analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry due to limited time frame required to analyze sample treated with A-V/Pi.

With this approach, we hoped to identify markers that can be targeted in future studies of sarcoidosis and potentially used for prognostic and ideally therapeutic measures.","Mass cytometry provides a powerful and sensitive means of understanding cellular mechanisms of disease that could prove especially valuable in heterogeneous conditions such as non-LS sarcoidosis, and markers that differentiate disease phenotypes could potentially be exploited for future therapeutic purposes in non-resolving disease. An more pronounced regulatory profile in LS along with decreased adhesive capacity of CD4+ T cells, offer a stark contrast to the non-LS effector profile and a direct link to characteristic clinical symptoms. The demonstrated ability to detect significant differences at the molecular level, despite low sample numbers and limited availability of cells from the lungs, could be employed to further distinguish between clinical subtypes, e.g. based on presence of extra-pulmonary symptoms.",,[bronchoalveolar lavage][mass cytometry][CD4+ T cells][sarcoidosis][Löfgren's syndrome],[28955342],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28955342, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5601005","[Sample Type = HC(1), LS(4), Non-LS(4), PBMC(3)]",12,66,Ylva Kaiser,Ylva Kaiser,Ylva Kaiser,2015-09-30 - 2017-02-03,2015-09-30,2017-02-03,2017-08-01,2017-09-01,"Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,  (Sweden)

FR-FCM-ZYC4,FR-FCM-ZYC4,1412,FAST: Rapid Determinations of Antibiotic Susceptibility Phenotypes using Label-Free Cytometry,"Sepsis is a life threatening response upon bacteria infection. Nevertheless, due to the low bacteria counts in blood (<= 1000 CFU/mL), it takes several overnight incubations to determine the effective antimicrobial treatment. These overnight incubations, including blood-culture, pathogen isolations and antibiotic susceptibility test (AST), can impose ~72 hours delay. These time consuming steps reduce patient's survival rate while increase the chance for bacteria to acquire the antibiotic resistance. A fast and robust AST is thus needed.","In our study, we develop a fast pre-blood culture AST (FAST) by analyzing the 2D-scatter cytometry data with the multidimensional statistics: Probability Binning - signature Quadratic Form (PB-sQF). With PB-sQF, the scatter signals of multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  and Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates with the starting concentration <= 100 CFU/mL only exhibit statistically significant shifts when effective antibiotic treatments were applied. As a result, using PB-sQF to characterize the 2D-scatter pattern,  AST can be done within 8 hours from the initial blood draw.",We observe only the forward and side scatters signal from a flow cytometer.

All these biological processes can be measured flow cytometrically allowing the determination of the type of cell death, G1 cell cycle arrest, cell cycle dependent measurement of ER stress transducer PERK, misfolded proteins, reticulophagy and autophagy marker LC3B. Jurkat cells after Tg or CQ treatment became necrotic and apoptotic, showed G1 cell cycle arrest, autophagy and ER stress. Prior induction of autophagy before ER stress increased levels of necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Autophagy was further up-regulated, while PERK was reduced or abrogated. CQ showed reduced levels of misfolded proteins and reticulophagy, while Tg showed no change in misfolded protein levels but increased reticulophagy and thus displayed more ER stress. Prior blockade of apoptosis before induction of ER stress resulted in cell survival except with high Tg levels which induced necrosis. Autophagy was up-regulated with modulation of PERK and reticulophagy levels with an abrogation of the misfolded protein response. Blockade of apoptosis with induction of autophagy before ER stress showed death by necrosis with high dose drugs and cell survival with low doses of drugs. CQ induced reduced levels G1 cell cycle arrest while it was maintained with Tg. Autophagy was also maintained with reduced levels of ER stress.

FR-FCM-ZYGJ,FR-FCM-ZYGJ,1555,Landscape and dynamics of CD32a+ CD4+ T cells from early HIV infection to effective cART,"CD32a has been reported to be a specific marker of latently HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. However, CD32a was recently found to be expressed on CD4+ T cells of healthy donors, suggesting that only a portion of CD32a+ CD4+ T cells is associated with HIV persistence. Here, we used mass cytometry to characterize the landscape and variation in the abundance of CD32a+ CD4+ T cells in primary HIV infection before and after effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and in healthy donors.","We found that CD32a+ CD4+ T cells include heterogeneous subsets that are differentially affected by HIV infection. Our analysis revealed that Naive (N), central memory (CM), and effector/memory (Eff/Mem) CD32a+ CD4+ T-cell clusters that co-express LILRA2 and CD64 activating receptors were more abundant in primary HIV infection and cART stages. Conversely, LILRA2- CD32a+ CD4+ T-cell clusters of either the TN, TCM, or TEff/Mem phenotype were more abundant in healthy individuals. Finally, an activated CD32a+ CD4+ TEff/Mem cell cluster co-expressing LILRA2, CD57, and NKG2C was more abundant in all HIV stages, particularly during primary HIV infection. This cell cluster positively correlated with the amount of HIV DNA.

The electrochemical performance and biofilm characteristics of pure cultures of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis are being compared to a defined mixed culture of both organisms. While S. oneidensis pure cultures did not form cohesive and stable biofilms on graphite anodes and only yielded 0.034 ± 0.011 mA/cm2 as maximum current density by feeding of each 5 mM lactate and acetate, G. sulfurreducens pure cultures formed 100 µm thick, area-wide biofilms with 10 mM acetate as initial substrate concentration and yielded a current of 0.39 ± 0.09 mA/cm2. Compared to the latter, a defined mixed culture of both species was able to yield 43 % higher maximum current densities of 0.56 ± 0.07 mA/cm² with each 5 mM lactate and acetate. This increase in current density was associated with a likewise increased thickness of the anodic biofilm.

                    Aspirates derived from femoral heads of 50 patients undergoing a hip replacement were used for the flow cytometric quantification of Ki-67 expression in the different hematopoietic cell populations of healthy bone marrow. Furthermore, the proliferative index was investigated in detail for the maturation steps during erythro-, myelo- and monopoiesis using recently described immunophenotypic profiles in combination with a software based maturation tool. 
                    Reference values for the proliferative index were established for the different relevant hematopoietic cell populations in healthy bone marrow. During maturation the size of the Ki-67 positive fraction was highest in the most immature compartment of the myeloid, monocytic and erythroid cell lineages, followed by a steady decline upon cell maturation. While proerythroblasts showed a proliferative activity of almost 100%, the myelo- and monoblast showed a lower proliferative index of on average 50%, indicating that a relatively large proportion of these cells exist in a quiescent state.
                  ","In conclusion we can state that when using a novel combination of immunophenotypic markers, the proliferation marker Ki-67, and a software based maturation tool, it was possible to determine the proliferative fractions in the diverse hematopoietic cell lineages in bone marrow, in particular during maturation. Using this approach the proliferative indices for the normal myelo-, mono- and erythropoiesis were determined, which can be used as a reference in future studies of hematologic malignancies originating from bone marrow.",,,[30176186],http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176186,,,22,Mathie Leers,Mathie Leers,Mathie Leers,2016-09-01 -,2016-09-01,,2018-06-01,2018-06-01,"Zuyderland Medical Center,  Dept. of Clinical Chemistry & Hematology, Sittard-Geleen,  (The Netherlands)",None,None,,,"merge_68.cyt, merge_68.cyt-(1), merge_73.cyt, merge_73.cyt-(1), merge_74.cyt, merge_74.cyt-(1), merge_75.cyt, merge_75.cyt-(1), merge.cyt, merge.cyt-(1), merged_78.cyt, 2a_kop_extra_00003802_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_19_00004194_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_21_00004202_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_23_00004218_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_24_00004220_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_25_00004275_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_27_00004279_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_28_00004277_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_29_00004283_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_3_00003832_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_30_00004287_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_31_00004289_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_32_00004291_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_33_00004302_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_34_00004296_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_35_00004298_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_36_00004309_002.LMD.cyt, Bot_37_00004311_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_10_00004005_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_11_00004007_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_12_00004042_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_13_00004044_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_14_00004143_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_15_00004145_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_16_00004179_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_4_00003842_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_5_00003844_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_6_00003888_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_7_00003925_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_8_00003927_002.LMD.cyt, Botkop_9_00003936_002.LMD.cyt",91976.036,431.812,213,7626.426,35.805,"FCS2.0(207), FCS3.0(6)",Navios(213)

Intestinal biopsies were obtained from 30 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (16 Crohn's disease and 14 ulcerative colitis patients) before and after the treatment with TNF a inhibitors (infliximab 13 patients, adalimumab 17 patients).","DCs were isolated from intestinal mucosal biopsies. Unlabelled cells and isotype control were used to facilitate separation between negative and positive cells. Plasmacytoid DCs are CD123+/CD303+ and conventional (myeloid) DCs are CD11c+ and were further investigated for CD80, CD83, CD86 expression.  Frequency of CD103+/CD103-DCs was presenting among the cDCs.",We prospectively investigated in vivo effects of TNF-a inhibitors on mucosal DCs in 30 IBD patients. This study confirmed previous observations on cDCs changes after treatment with TNF-a inhibitors. Patients responding to treatment with TNF-a inhibitors had significantly higher proportion of conventional dendritic cells with higher expression of HLA-DR in inflamed mucosa before treatment compared to non-responders.,[dendritic cells][IBD][anti-TNF-a ],,,,,27,Andreja Natasa Kopitar,Andreja Natasa Kopitar,Andreja Natasa Kopitar,2014-03-05 - 2017-07-31,2014-03-05,2017-07-31,2018-07-01,2018-08-01,None,Not disclosed,To standardize voltage settings across samples acquired on different days BD FACS Diva CS&T beads were run every day.

                    Cell lines were kept in sealed tubes for 1, 3, and 6 hours at either 37 degrees, room temperature, or 4 degrees. Following an hour rest in a 37 degree humidified incubator the cells were stained with IdU then smart tube fixed. A separate experiment tested the short term effect of storage by storing cells for 15, 30, and 45 minutes with no additional rest period before IdU staining and fixation. Finally an experiment was performed where cells were cryogenically frozen then thawed after a week in storage and were collected at serial time points for IdU stain and fixation.
                    
                    Bone marrow samples collected from patients was used to test the effects of short term and cryogenic storage on primary samples. At sample collection IdU was added to an aliquot of bone marrow

These protocols are a replication of the experiment reported in Figure 2F of Vermeulen et al., 2010. Additionally, single cell sorting for extreme-limiting dilution analysis (in vitro and in vivo) was performed. This experiment will assess the effect of MFCM and recombinant HGF on the clonogenic potential of the TOP-GFP CSC clones and also examine the ability of the small molecular c-Met inhibitor, PHA-665752, to block MFCM- or HGF-triggered clonogenicity (Protocol 3). This is a replication of the experiment reported in Figure 6D of Vermeulen et al., 2010.. This experiment will assess the effect of MFCM on the tumorigenicity potential of one of the TOP-GFP CSC clones (Protocol 4), which is a replication of Figure 7E of Vermeulen et al., 2010.","We found the TOP-GFPhigh populations were more enriched for CD133+ or CD166+ cells compared to the TOP-GFPlow populations for each of the three cultures (Figure 1C,D). There were also more CD29+ cells in the TOP-GFPhigh populations for each of the three cultures, while the two TOP-GFP populations were mostly similar for CD24 expression.  We also found the TOP-GFPlow populations from E450 and CSC1 cultures were more enriched for CD44+ cells, while both the populations displayed similar expression for Co100. We found the clonogenic potential of TOP-GFPhigh cells were greater than TOP-GFPlow cells for each of the three cultures (Figure 2). We also observed that the clonogenicity of TOP-GFPlow cells were increased in the presence of MCFM or HGF, which was reduced when PHA665752 was included, although to varying degrees across the different cultures. Interestingly, PHA665752 treatment on the whole population of TOP-GFP cells (TOP-GFPwhole) had varying effects on the clonogenicity among the different cultures tested. Both the Co100 and E450 cultures had decreased clonogenicity in the presence of PHA665752, while CSC1 cultures were increased. We found the frequency of tumorigenicity was similar when TOP-GFPhigh cells (1 in every 3332, 95% CI [9174, 1210]) or TOP-GFPlow cells (1 in every 2744, 95% CI [7377, 1020]) were injected (Table 1), which was not a statistically significant difference (",This is experiment is part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/).

In contrast, using BD Application Settings (adjusted PMTs) resulted in larger day-to-day variations. This larger variation seemed, at least in part, to be a result of “over-adjustment” of PMTs by Application Settings. Thus, the present findings call for caution in using Application Settings to improve stability of cell subset quantifications and especially MFI measurements in longitudinal studies. This is of special importance when also re-using a compensation matrix. As an alternative, we recommend inclusion of reference particles (e.g. Rainbow beads) to confirm cytometer stability. With a verified stable cytometer, and using fixed PMT settings, for some experiments re-use of a compensation matrix over time may be feasible. However, we do encourage special caution with this approach, and emphasize the opinion by most flow cytometry experts, that running fresh compensation samples with each experiment is the best practice.

FR-FCM-ZYUW,FR-FCM-ZYUW,2002,Empirical measures of mutational effects define neutral models of regulatory evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Understanding how phenotypes evolve requires disentangling the effects of mutation generating new variation from the effects of selection filtering it. Evolutionary models frequently assume that mutation introduces phenotypic variation symmetrically around the population mean, yet few studies have tested this assumption by deeply sampling the distributions of mutational effects for particular traits. Here, we examine distributions of mutational effects by measuring the phenotypic consequences of thousands of point mutations introduced randomly throughout the genome. Specifically, we use these mutations to determine the distribution of mutational effects on gene expression for ten genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that these distributions of mutational effects differ among genes and generally violate the assumption of normality. For example, all of the distributions of mutational effects examined included more mutations with large effects than expected for normally distributed phenotypes. In addition, some genes also showed asymmetries in their distribution of mutational effects, with new mutations more likely to increase than decrease the gene?s expression or vice versa. Neutral models of regulatory evolution that take these empirically determined distributions into account suggest that neutral processes may explain more expression variation within natural populations than currently appreciated.",None,,[Gene expression][Mutation][Genetic Reporters][distribution of mutational effects][regulatory evolution.],,,,,22,Andrea Hodgins-Davis,Patricia Wittkopp,Andrea Hodgins-Davis,2017-09-01 -,2017-09-01,,2019-01-01,2019-09-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (USA)","NIH R01 GM108826 (Wittkopp)

Several computational approaches have been developed in flow cytometry to increase the number of simultaneously measurable markers. These approaches aim to combine phenotypic information of different cytometric profiles obtained from different cytometry panels.
                    We present here a new algorithm, called CytoBackBone, which can merge phenotypic information from different cytometric profiles. This algorithm is based on nearest-neighbor imputation, but introduces the notion of acceptable and non-ambiguous nearest neighbors. We used mass cytometry data to illustrate the merging of cytometric profiles obtained by the CytoBackBone algorithm. The CytoBackBone algorithm has been implemented in R, based on the flowCore, flowUtils, and FNN packages. The source code of CytoBackBone is available at https://github.com/tchitchek-lab/CytoBackBone.

However, they also impact the immune systems, and it depends on the given context whether this is beneficial or not. The attenuated vaccinia virus strain MVA has been used as a viral vector in clinical studies intended to treat and prevent cancer and infectious diseases. The adjuvant property of MVA is thought to be due to its capability to stimulate innate immunity. Here, we confirmed that MVA induces interleukin-8 (IL-8), and this chemokine was upregulated significantly more in monocytes and HLA-DRbright DCs of HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) than in cells of healthy persons. 
                    
                    The effect of MVA on cell surface receptors is mostly unknown. Using mass cytometry profiling, we investigated the expression of 17 cell surface receptors in leukocytes after ex vivo infection of human whole blood samples with MVA.
                  ","We found that MVA downregulates most of the characteristic cell surface markers in particular types of leukocytes. In contrast, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was significantly upregulated in each leukocyte type of healthy persons. 
                    Additionally, we detected a relative high cell surface expression of the HIV-1 coreceptors C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXCR4 in leukocytes of HIV-ART patients than in healthy persons. Importantly, we showed that MVA infection significantly downregulated CCR5 in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and three different dendritic cell (DC) populations. CD86, a costimulatory molecule for T cells, was significantly upregulated in HLA-DRbright DCs after MVA infection of whole blood from HIV-ART patients. However, MVA was unable to downregulate cell surface expression of CD11b and CD32 in monocytes and neutrophils of HIV-ART patients to the same extent as in monocytes and neutrophils of healthy persons. 
                    In summary, MVA modulates the expression of many different kinds of cell surface receptors in leukocytes, which can vary in cells originating from persons previously infected with other pathogens.",,[mass cytometry][vaccination][MVA][AIDS][chemokine][cytokine][poxvirus][surface marker],,,"[Conditions = CTRL(10), MVA(10)]",20,83,Nicolas Tchitchek,Nicolas Tchitchek,Nicolas Tchitchek,2019-02-12 - 2019-02-12,2019-02-12,2019-02-12,2019-02-01,2020-07-01,"CEA,  Division of Immuno-Virology, DSV/iMETI, Fontenay-aux-Roses,  (France)",The IDMIT infrastructure is supported by the French government “Programme d’Investissements d’Avenir” (PIA) under Grant ANR-11-INBS-0008 and grant ANR-10-EQPX-02-01 (FlowCyTech facility).

                    Abstract
                    The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue in rodents and primates contains mesenchymal stem cells and immune cells. SVF cells have complex metabolic, immune and endocrine functions with biomedical impact. However, in other mammals, the amount of data on SVF stem cells is negligible and whether the SVF hosts immune cells is unknown. In this study, we show that the SVF is rich in immune cells, with a dominance of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), domestic cat (Felis catus) and domestic dog (Canis familiaris). ATMs of these species are granulated lysosome-rich cells with lamellipodial protrusions and express the lysosome markers acid phosphatase 5 (ACP-5) and Mac-3/Lamp-2. Using ACP-5 and Mac-3/Lamp-2 as markers, we additionally detected ATMs in other species, such as the domestic horse (Equus ferus caballus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Feline and canine ATMs also express the murine macrophage marker F4/80 antigen. In the lean condition, the alternative macrophage activation marker CD206 is expressed by feline and canine ATMs and arginase-1 by feline ATMs. Obesity is associated with interleukin-6 and interferon gamma expression and with overt tyrosine nitration in both feline and canine ATMs. This resembles the obesity-induced phenotype switch of murine and human ATMs. Thus, we show, for the first time, that the presence of ATMs is a general trait of mammals. The interaction between the adipose cells and SVF immune cells might be evolutionarily conserved among mammals.",,,,,,,34,Tamás Röszer,Tamás Röszer,Tamás Röszer,2014-02-01 - 2015-01-01,2014-02-01,2015-01-01,2019-02-01,2019-05-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,WSP,NOS2_positive_control.wsp,3728.108,77.669,48,178.587,3.721,FCS3.0(48),LSRII(48)

FR-FCM-ZYW2,FR-FCM-ZYW2,1602,Napolitani et al Nat. Immunol. 2018 Mass Cytometry data,"                    Clonal analysis of Typhoidal Salmonella specific effector CD4+ T cells in challenged human volunteers reveals immunodominant Serovar specific and cross-reactive T cell responses
                    
                    The characterization of the phenotype and specificity of human T cells responding to bacterial pathogens is hampered by the large number of protein antigens and by the possible presence of cross-reactive responses dependent on the large degree of sequence homology between related species.
                    We took advantage of a human challenge model of enteric fever to provide the first characterization of the pathogen specific repertoire of effector CD4 T cells elicited in response to infection with Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A.
                    Performing an unbiased clonal analysis of the specificity of a population of CD38+CCR7-Ki67+ IFN- Mip1 producing effector CD4 T cells released during enteric fever we found that the Salmonella specific effector T cell pool included clones cross-reactive against distantly related Salmonella Serovars as well as clones selectively recognizing the Typhoidal Serovars S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. The Typhoidal specific response was dominated by cells specific for two immune-dominant S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A virulence factors, namely Cytolethal distending toxin (CDTB) and Hemolysin E (HlyE). Furthermore, a single amino acid variation in the sequence of CDTB accounted for a major fraction of clones non-cross-reactive among the two Typhoidal Serovars, providing a unique example of how minor antigenic variation in antigenically complex micro-organism can have a sizable impact in the pathogen specific repertoire of CD4 T cells.

                  ","Stimulation, Staining, and CyTOF Data Acquisition
                    Cryopreserved cells were thawed and washed with pre-warmed RPMI supplemented with 1-% FBS (GIBCO, Life Technologies), 1X Penicliin/Streptomycin/L-glutamine (GIBCO, Life Technologies), 1% 1M HEPES (GIBCO, Life Technologies) and 1X β-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO, Life Technologies). Cells from each sample were split into two wells, followed by staining with the indicated antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) in 96-well round bottom plates for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to stimulation. Cells were left untreated or stimulated at 37°C for 4 hours with 150 ng/ml phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of monensin and Brefeldin A (eBioscience). 
                    
                    After stimulation, cells were washed twice in cold PBS, followed by incubation on ice with 200 μM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes. Cells were then washed with CyFACS buffer (PBS + 4% FBS + 0.05% sodium azide) and stained with streptavidin-alpha Galcer with 10 μM free biotin for 30 minutes at room temperature. This was followed by 30 minutes incubation in primary antibody cocktail on ice. Cells were then washed twice in CyFACS and stained with metal-tagged surface antibodies. After 30 minutes, stimulated cells were washed twice with CyFACS, once with PBS, and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 4°C. The untreated cells were washed twice with CyFACS and incubated in Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice in 1 x Permeabilization (perm) Buffer (Biolegend) and stained with biotin anti-human Foxp3 and metal-tagged intracellular antibodies for 30 minutes on ice. After washing twice with perm buffer, cells were incubated on ice with metal-tagged streptavidin for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed twice in perm buffer, once in PBS, and then fixed in 2% PFA at 4°C. The next day, stimulated cells were washed twice with perm buffer and stained with intracellular antibodies on ice. After 30 minutes, all the untreated and stimulated cells were washed twice with perm buffer and once with PBS. Cells were then incubated with cellular barcodes for 30 minutes as previously described 40. Subsequently, cells were washed once with perm buffer and incubated in CyFACS for 10 minutes on ice. Cellular DNA was labeled at room temperature with 250 nM iridium interchelator (Fluidigm) diluted in PBS with 2% PFA. After 20 minutes, cells were washed twice with CyFACS and twice in distilled water prior to acquisition. 
                    
                    To accommodate the required numbers of samples, two barcoded batches were prepared for each panel, with each batch having comparable number of samples for each of the time-points. Mass-tag barcoding was used so that all samples could be acquired simultaneously. A uniquely barcoded sample of PBMCs from a healthy donor was also included in batch as an internal control. EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) were added at a final concentration of 1% prior to sample acquisition. Cells acquisition was performed on CyTOF2 (Fluidigm).    
                    
                    Data Analysis:
                    After mass cytometry acquisition, data were exported in flow-cytometry file (FCS) format, normalized41 and events with parameters having zero values were randomized using a uniform distribution of values between minus-one and zero. Each sample containing a unique combination of two metal barcodes was de-convoluted using manual gating in FlowJo to select cells stained with two and only two barcoding channels. 
                    
                    Heterogeneity CD4+Ki67+ cells was evaluated with the Phenograph algorithm20 embedded in the Bioconductor CyTOFkit package 42. A total of 6185 cells was analysed.

FR-FCM-ZYWM,FR-FCM-ZYWM,1622,"Data from Simoni et al, Nature 2018","Various forms of immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, are proving to be remarkably effective at restoring T cell mediated immune responses that can lead to dramatic and sustained clinical responses but only in some patients and cancer types. Unpredictable responsiveness may be partly due to heterogeneity of the immune composition and phenotypic profiles of TILs within individual tumours and between patients. Although there is evidence that tumour-mutation derived neoantigen specific T cells play a role in tumour control, in most cases the antigen-specificities of phenotypically diverse tumour infiltrating T cells are largely unknown. Here we show that human lung and colorectal cancer CD8+ TILs can not only be specific for tumour antigens (e.g. neoantigens), but can also recognize a wide range of cancer-unrelated epitopes (e.g. from EBV, HCMV or Influenza virus).  We found that these bystander CD8+ TILs have diverse phenotypes that overlap with tumour-specific cells, but lack expression of CD39. In colorectal and lung tumours, the absence of CD39 by CD8+ TILs defines populations whose phenotypes lack hallmarks of chronic antigen stimulation at the tumour site, supporting their classification as bystanders. Expression of CD39 varied dramatically between patients, with some patients having predominantly CD39? CD8+ TILs. Furthermore, frequencies of CD39 expression correlated with some important clinical stratifications, such as lung tumour EGFR mutation status.  Our results demonstrate that not all tumour-infiltrating T cells are tumour-specific, and suggest measuring CD39 expression as a straightforward way to quantify or isolate bystander T cells.",None,"Data from Simoni et al, Nature 2018

Visualizing and understanding these large high-dimensional datasets poses a major analytical challenge. Mass cytometry allows for simultaneous measurement of more than 40 different proteins, permitting in-depth analysis of multiple aspects of cellular diversity. Here, we present One-SENSE (One-dimensional Soli-Expression by Nonlinear Stochastic Embedding), a dimensionality reduction method based on the t-SNE algorithm, for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data. With One-SENSE, measured parameters are grouped into predefined categories, and cells are projected onto a space composed of one dimension for each category. In contrast to higher-dimensional t-SNE, each dimension (plot axis) in One-SENSE has biological meaning that can be easily annotated with binned heatplots. We applied One-SENSE to probe relationships between categories of human T cell phenotypes, and observed previously unappreciated cellular populations within an orchestrated view of immune cell diversity.

FR-FCM-ZYZX,FR-FCM-ZYZX,1048,Data from Simoni et al Immunity 2017,"                    Animal models have highlighted the importance
                    of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in multiple immune
                    responses. However, technical limitations have
                    hampered adequate characterization of ILCs in humans.
                    Here, we used mass cytometry including a
                    broad range of surface markers and transcription
                    factors to accurately identify and profile ILCs
                    across healthy and inflamed tissue types. High
                    dimensional analysis allowed for clear phenotypic
                    delineation of ILC2 and ILC3 subsets. We were
                    not able to detect ILC1 cells in any of the tissues
                    assessed, however, we identified intra-epithelial
                    (ie)ILC1-like cells that represent a broader category
                    of NK cells in mucosal and non-mucosal pathological
                    tissues. In addition, we have revealed the
                    expression of phenotypic molecules that have not
                    been previously described for ILCs. Our analysis
                    shows that human ILCs are highly heterogeneous
                    cell types between individuals and tissues. It also
                    provides a global, comprehensive, and detailed
                    description of ILC heterogeneity in humans across
                    patients and tissues.

FR-FCM-ZZ4B,FR-FCM-ZZ4B,139,Optimized lymphocyte subsets by CD7 and CD33,Two problems have remained at identification and quantification of lymphocyte subsets: the incomplete removal of non-lymphoid cells from the lymphocyte gate and the lack of a restricted marker to identify NK cells. By replacing well-established  CD14 by CD33 and CD16/CD56 by CD7 we expected to remove even basophils and CD14- monocyte subsets from the gate and to avoid misclassification of CD16+ respectively CD56+ monocytes.,"The advantage of CD33 over CD14 at the creation of a pure lymphocyte gate could be demonstrated. CD33 enables the exclusion of all monocyte subpopulations as well as basophils and granulocytes. CD7 and CD16/56 exhibited as equivalent in various CD33 settings, whereas the mean proportion of single CD56+ NK cells was significantly lower. As CD7 is restricted to T cells and NK cells in peripheral blood, misclassification of contaminating monocytes is avoided and CD7+ NK cells can be identified by lack of CD3. Use of CD33/CD7 causes a mean purity of about 99.5% within the revised lymphocyte gate. High inclusivity and high purity can be achieved concurrently, so the comparability of reference values may be increased. We propose the adoption of CD7 and CD33 for the quantification of lymphocyte subsets.",,[flow cytometry][lymphocyte subsets][CD7 antigen][CD33 antigen][NK cells][monocytes][basophils],[23315982],http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23315982,,,32,Andrea Hauser,Andrea Hauser,Andrea Hauser,2012-07-26 - 2012-07-30,2012-07-26,2012-07-30,2012-11-01,2013-01-01,"Donauspital,  Department of Laboratory Medicine, Vienna,  (Austria)",Not disclosed,"Compensation was accomplished automatically by use of Flow-Set™ Fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA USA) and single-stained tubes containing CD45 in FITC respectively in PE, ECD, PE-CY5 or PE-CY7 and subsequent verification by a combination of CD4/CD8/CD45/CD3/CD19 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA USA).

The annuli were laid on photomultiplier side of the 530BP filter and held in place by gravity.  The target attenuations were 90\%, 75\% and 25\%.  The actual attenuations achieved were 91\%, 70\% and 25\%. The signals in all the other channels were not attenuated. (2) Increased noise levels, a flashlight with in an incandescent light bulb was shined into the area of the flow cell to increase the background light levels.  Adjustment of the angle of illumination and distance of the flashlight from the flow cell allowed different levels of background light to enter the measurement area.  The background light affected all channels.  Background light levels were only qualitatively adjusted and chosen at three arbitrary levels of high, medium and low.  Dataset was used to test our R package flowQB's ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for its modelling and implementation.

Conversely, H-2Db (or Db) bearing animals typically do not increase this subset and we saw they were then unable to control virus. Overall, the G2+ NK subset had a best-fit relationship with Dk protection against MCMV. However, there were a few H-2k bearing animals that were unable to increase their G2+ population (H-2k atypicals), and their viral loads closely matched those of typical H-2Db mice. Conversely, there were a few Db-bearing animals who increased their frequency of G2+ NK cells, and were able to control virus like that of typical H-2k animals. The G2+ NK cell frequency can still correspond with viral control in animals where Dk is not present. Another genetic factor enabled the NK cells of these Db atypical mice to render some innate MCMV control.
                    
                    Ly49G2 or I/U intensity had little to no effect on viral load.
                    
                    High frequency of G2 SP NK cells corresponded well to reduced weight loss, higher frequency of total G2+ NK's, a lower frequency of G2-I/U- (DN) NK cells, and a higher NKp46 MFI in the offspring. However, spleen MCMV correlated the best with altered body weight.
                    
                    Based on multiple regression analyses, we found that mice before infection who had more DN NK cells and lower G2 MFI had a statistically significant benefit in MCMV protection later. We also found that NKp46 MFI in all NK cells negatively correlated with spleen viral load. So other NK cell surface receptors besides G2likely contributed to overall viral control in these animals.
                    
                    Licensed G2+ NK cells regulate higher NKp46 MFI in the G2- subset, where its display then best predicts viral control. The unlicensed populations in animals where licensing occurs still play an important role in viral control.","A preliminary experiment was performed that showed how NK receptor data analyzed from the blood of a particular mouse (cell frequencies, MFI values) was comparable to the data coming from that same animal's splenocytes.

In long-term HIV-envelope dependent syncytia formation experiments, we observed that the number of CD4+ cells was reduced up to 10-fold respective to control cells without significant loss of cell viability. The absolute number of CD4+ cells that remained unfused was restored after the addition of the peptide-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitor T-20, indicating that the reduction of the number of CD4+ cells was due to fusion and not to inhibition of proliferation or death. In contrast, the number of Env+ cells did not increased through the experiment. Regarding syncytia, 90% percent of those generated in the first hours of coculture remained alive after 48 hours and they were consistently more viable than single Env+ cells in the co-culture.","Tru Count Tubes were used in combination with the labeling of fusion partners with DiI and DiO probes in a three-color assay for quantification of fused and unfused cells during syncytia formation experiments. We have previously shown that the labeling of fusion partners with fluorescent lipophilic probes (DiI and DiO) and analysis by flow cytometry, allow the quantification of cell fusion during HIV-envelope dependent syncytia formation (Huerta L. 2002. Cytometry 2002, 1; 47(2): 100-106; Huerta L. et al. J Virol Methods. 2006, 138(1-2): 17-23). Here, the absolute cell number and viability were determined in 4-day co-cultures of Jurkat HIV-1 envelope-expressing cells (Env+ cells) with CD4+ cells, using the labeling with lipophilic probes and True Count tubes in a three-color flow cytometry assay. For determination of the absolute number of cells during syncytium formation, the following gating was applied:  
                    1) Viable cells were selected using a forward scatter (FSC-H) versus side scatter (SSC-H) dot plot, where a region was delineated excluding cell debris and dead cells (R1 in Fig. 1A).
                    2) Then, a FL1-H versus FL2-H dot plot was constructed for cells in R1.
                    By applying compensation as described in section 4.2, the DiI and DiO fluorescence allowed the discrimination of syncytia and unfused cells as double and single fluorescent particles, respectively (Fig. 1B). 
                    Fluorescent beads were detected in the FL4-H fluorescence channel clearly separated from red and green cells (Fig. 1C). The plot was constructed without threshold on forward scatter (FCS) due to the small size of the beads.
                    Once proper regions were determined for the clear distinction of syncytia, unfused cells, and fluorescent beads, a fixed number of beads were acquired. The absolute number of each cell population was calculated as: (number of beads acquired/number of total beads in the tube) X number of cells acquired.",[HIV][flow cytometry][Cell-cell fusion][syncytia][absolute cell counting],[11813199],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11813199, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958674, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16934339, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014923, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19705036, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20508956, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21110955, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442370",,,30,Leonor Huerta,Leonor Huerta,Leonor Huerta,2010-02-08 -,2010-02-08,,2013-02-01,2014-03-01,"Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,  Immunology, Mexico City,  (Mexico)",Not disclosed,"To standardize voltage settings and compensation conditions, as well for definition of regions corresponding to fused and unfused cell populations, unlabeled and single-labeled cell suspensions were used as controls for each experiment and for each day in a given experiment.

                    The amount of aggregated cells was restricted to  2-3 % of the double fluorescent particles, as demonstrated before on the base of the enhanced red fluorescence in the fused cell population due to FRET (Ref. 24 of the manuscript).

Unfused CD4+ cells showed a cell cycle status typical of a proliferating cell line, whereas Env+ cells showed an arrest at the G1 phase.

The presence of staining inhibitors was tested for each reference standard used. Comparative estimation of nuclear DNA content was carried out by flow cytometry, and it was shown that the 2C value was consistent in all cases. The addition of antioxidants helps in reducing the extent of inhibition. The 2C value was estimated to be 2.51pg.","The manuscript entitled ?dynamics of genome size and its co-relation to chromosome number of P. pinnata? shows the optimisation of nuclear isolation buffer exclusively for P. pinnata. Isolation of nuclei from the tender leaves of P. pinnata was really a great challenge as the nuclei was disintegrated in detergents apart from IGEPAL CA- 630 (NP-40). When isolation of nuclei was successfully established, the external standardization was preliminary followed to find the genome size of the P. pinnata. Recent techniques of flow cytometric protocol paved the way to internal standardization. Preliminary experiments of P. pinnata in both internal and external standardization show us there was the inhibition of the P. pinnata cytosol on the mean fluorescence of the standard nuclei. So using the current established protocols the inhibition was proved. The effect of different volume combinations on the nuclear DNA content estimated in pseudo-internal and internal standardization was evaluated. The deviation from the proportional relationship of mean P. pinnata fluorescence and mean standard nuclei fluorescence motivated us to add antioxidants (PVP and  2-mercaptoethanol). Although their addition could not able to alleviate the inhibitory effect of P. pinnata cytosol, their addition reduced the inhibition to the minimum (least percentage shift of the mean standard nuclei fluorescence due to internal standardization and the best fit curve of the antioxidant- nuclear isolation buffer combinations). So the originality of the manuscript lies in the least quantitative shift of the standard nuclei fluorescence and use of the best fit curve of different standardization methods and different antioxidant- nuclear isolation buffer combinations to alleviate the P .pinnata cytosol effect paving the way to accurate estimation of the nuclear DNA content.

The presence of staining inhibitors was tested for each reference standard used. Comparative estimation of nuclear DNA content was carried out by flow cytometry, and it was shown that the 2C value was consistent in all cases. The addition of antioxidants helps in reducing the extent of inhibition. The 2C value was estimated to be 2.51pg.","The manuscript entitled ?dynamics of genome size and its co-relation to chromosome number of P. pinnata? shows the optimisation of nuclear isolation buffer exclusively for P. pinnata. Isolation of nuclei from the tender leaves of P. pinnata was really a great challenge as the nuclei was disintegrated in detergents apart from IGEPAL CA- 630 (NP-40). When isolation of nuclei was successfully established, the external standardization was preliminary followed to find the genome size of the P. pinnata. Recent techniques of flow cytometric protocol paved the way to internal standardization. Preliminary experiments of P. pinnata in both internal and external standardization show us there was the inhibition of the P. pinnata cytosol on the mean fluorescence of the standard nuclei. So using the current established protocols the inhibition was proved. The effect of different volume combinations on the nuclear DNA content estimated in pseudo-internal and internal standardization was evaluated. The deviation from the proportional relationship of mean P. pinnata fluorescence and mean standard nuclei fluorescence motivated us to add antioxidants (PVP and  2-mercaptoethanol). Although their addition could not able to alleviate the inhibitory effect of P. pinnata cytosol, their addition reduced the inhibition to the minimum (least percentage shift of the mean standard nuclei fluorescence due to internal standardization and the best fit curve of the antioxidant- nuclear isolation buffer combinations). So the originality of the manuscript lies in the least quantitative shift of the standard nuclei fluorescence and use of the best fit curve of different standardization methods and different antioxidant- nuclear isolation buffer combinations to alleviate the P .pinnata cytosol effect paving the way to accurate estimation of the nuclear DNA content.

FR-FCM-ZZ9R,FR-FCM-ZZ9R,315,Biomass Measurement in Solid-State Fermentation of Basidiomycetes by Flow Cytometry,"The solid-state fermentation (SSF) is a robust process which is perfectly suitable for the on-site cultivation of basidiomycetes, where fungi serve as enzyme producers for the treatment of lignocellulosics. The quantification of fungal biomass is essential for growth kinetics analysis. In SSF a direct biomass determination is not possible, because fungi grow into the substrate and use it as a nutrient source. Therefore, it is necessary to use indirect methods which are either very laborious and time-intensive, or can only refer to the biomass at certain growth periods. In the present study an alternative and rapid method was developed and optimized for the biomass determination during SSF by measuring the number of fungal nuclei by flow cytometry. Fungal biomass was grown on an organic substrate and its concentration was measured by isolating the nuclei from the fungal hyphae after cell disruption, staining their nuclei with SYTOX® Green, and subsequently counting the nuclei using a flow cytometer. It was possible to establish a calibration curve for the dry biomass and the concentration of the nuclei. Different buffer and disruption methods were tested. The results were compared with the method of ergosterol determination, a classical method of fungal biomass measurement in SSF. This approach allowed the calculation of fungal biomass at different scales ? from 15 mL up to the laboratory reactor with a working volume of 10 L (developed by the Research Center for Medical Technology and Biotechnology (fzmb GmbH)).","We could show that the biomass determination by flow cytometry is a good alternative technique for the determination of fungal biomass in SSF offering a lot of potential and advantages, like easy handling and rapidity.

The BAL cell profile was similar between groups.  
                    
                    From a technical perspective BAL and blood from both groups was collected and treated using the same protocols.  The same number of BAL lymphocytes were seeded between both groups.  Cells from both groups were stimulated with equal concentrations of 1) Whole pneumococcal cells (""6B"" serotype) that had been washed and killed and resuspended in PBS to a known concentration 2) a concentrated culture supernatant (""c/s"") from 6B grown in vegetone broth.  We ensured that the pneumococcus was grown in the same broth as that used to inoculate our volunteers.  3) To check for cell responses to the vegetone broth as opposed to the pneumococcus we stimulated cells with a broth control (""vehicle"" or control"").   Any responses detected in this sample were subtracted from 2) above and were described as pneumococcal specific responses.  4) staphylococcal enterotoxin B - this served as a positive control 5) Flu - this also served as a positive control for the assay (since most people should have detectable flu responses) but also as a negative experimental control since our hypothesis was that pneumococal carriage should only augment pneumococcal specific responses but not those to unrelated respiratory antigens such as flu.  Some files may contain data from a 6th stimulus (WCA) where sufficient cells permitted but this data was not used in the final manuscript.     
                    
                    Following stimulation cells were harvested and stained for T cell markers (CD4APCCy7, CD3 APC, CD45ROPEC7) and cell viability (aquavid) followed by fixation and permeabilisation. Fixed and permeabilised cells were stained with antibodies to TNF (FITC), IL-17 (PE) and IFNgamma (AF700) followed by analysis by flow cytometry. cells that were negative for the respective markers served as internal controls to assess positive or negative staining.  Reference to positive controls (SEB or flu) and negative controls (vehicle or unstimulated cells) were useful to discriminate positive from negative cytokine responses.  In experiments prior to this paper and in some cases where cell numbers allowed cells stimulated with SEB were stained for isotype controls to TNF/IFNgamma and IL-17 to check specificity.

FR-FCM-ZZNR,FR-FCM-ZZNR,763,Contrasting frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations affecting gene expression,"Heritable differences in gene expression are caused by mutations in DNA sequences encoding cis¬-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors. These two classes of regulatory change differ in their relative contributions to expression differences in natural populations and are the result of the combined effects of mutation and natural selection. Here, we investigate how new mutations create the regulatory variation upon which natural selection acts by quantifying the frequencies and effects of hundreds of new cis- and trans-acting mutations altering activity of the TDH3 promoter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of natural selection. We find that cis-regulatory mutations have larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory mutations and that while trans-regulatory mutations are more common overall, cis- and trans-regulatory changes in expression are equally abundant when only the largest changes in expression are considered. In addition, we find that cis-regulatory mutations are skewed towards decreased expression while trans-regulatory mutations are skewed towards increased expression. We also measure the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations on the variability in gene expression among genetically identical cells, a property of gene expression known as expression noise, finding that trans-regulatory mutations are much more likely to decrease expression noise than cis-regulatory mutations. Because new mutations are the raw material upon which natural selection acts, these differences in the frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations should be considered when creating models of regulatory evolution.",None,,,[26782996],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26782996, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909133",,,16,Brian Metzger,Patricia Wittkopp,Brian Metzger,2015-01-01 - 2015-12-31,2015-01-01,2015-12-31,2015-12-01,2017-06-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,,,218383.753,15.797,13824,11706.296,0.847,FCS3.0(13824),"BD Accuri C6(12384), IntelliCyt Cytometer(1440)"

Subcommunities with high abundant cell numbers formed the endpoint characteristics whereas those with lower cell numbers were involved in dispersal, especially in case of a recorded on-site perturbation. We found abiotic parameters influencing local communities and rare cells announcing community restructuration processes after perturbation. An increase in inter-locality correlations reported the presence of mass-effects under perturbation but did not unbalance the predominant species-sorting paradigm in the studied WWTP.","A full scale WWTP was sampled for 389 days at six localities: A (primary sludge), B (primary clarifier), C (aeration tank), D (excess sludge), E (anaerobic digester) and F (anaerobic digester centrate). The samples were fixed, stained with DAPI and measured flow cytometrically. Microbial communities comprising thousands of unknown organisms can be studied flow cytometrically by applying just one fluorescent parameter and using scatter characteristics of cells. If the resulting 2D-histograms are analyzed with a gate template bioinformatics tools can be applied to yield information about community dynamics (flowCHIC; http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCHIC.html) and interactions with available data from biotic and abiotic parameters (flowCybar; www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCyBar.html).

Forward scatter was detected with a H6779-32 PMT after passing a DM 390 A mirror and an IBP 355 B bandpass filter. Sideward scatter was directed through an IBP 355 B bandpass filter before detection by a H6779-32 PMT. Blue fluorescence was detected using an IBP 455 C filter and an H6779-32 PMT. All PMTs were from Hamamatsu photonics (Japan) and optical filters and mirrors from Zeiss (Germany). Sample flow rate of the cytometer was 0.5 µl/s during measurement at an event rate of not more than 1000-3000 cells per second. For each sample at least 250,000 stained cells were recorded.

FR-FCM-ZZTM,FR-FCM-ZZTM,950,Data from Wong et al Immunity  2016,Analysis of lymphocyte composition across human tissues using two mass cytometry panels.,"Depending on the tissue microenvironment, T cells can differentiate into highly diverse subsets expressing unique trafficking receptors and cytokines. Studies of human lymphocytes have primarily focused on a limited number of parameters in blood, representing an incomplete view of the human immune system. Here, we have utilized mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze T cell trafficking and functional markers across eight different human tissues, including blood, lymphoid, and non-lymphoid tissues. These data have revealed that combinatorial expression of trafficking receptors and cytokines better defines tissue specificity. Notably, we identified numerous T helper cell subsets with overlapping cytokine expression, but only specific cytokine combinations are secreted regardless of tissue type. This indicates that T cell lineages defined in mouse models cannot be clearly distinguished in humans. Overall, our data uncover a plethora of tissue immune signatures and provide a systemic map of how T cell phenotypes are altered throughout the human body.","See paper for description of data.

Relative expression patterns across CD45 hematopoietic cell subsets were similar to those observed among analogous subsets in whole blood, with myeloid cells showing higher expression than T cells. Notably, we found that CD45-CD326+ lung epithelial cells expressed much higher levels of WGA and Os-192 staining than hematopoietic cells, consistent with their larger expected cell size. Interestingly, some broadly defined populations, such as macrophages, showed heterogeneous WGA and Os-192 expression, suggesting the potential utility of these reagents in revealing additional heterogeneity in complex cellular samples beyond that identified by traditional antibody staining.

FR-FCM-ZZVU,FR-FCM-ZZVU,1022,Mass cytometry of follicular lymphoma tumors reveals intrinsic heterogeneity in proteins including HLA-DR and a deficit in non-malignant plasmablast and germinal center B cell populations,"                    Abstract
                    Background: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has a risk of transformation to more aggressive lymphoma.  Relatively little is known about the non-malignant B-cell and T-cell subset composition within the tumor microenvironment and whether altered phenotypes are associated with patterns of lymphoma B-cell heterogeneity.
                    Methods: Two mass cytometry (CyTOF) panels were designed to immunophenotype B and T cells in FL tumors.  Populations of malignant B cells, non-malignant B cells, and T cells from each FL tumor were identified and their phenotypes compared to B and T cells from healthy human tonsillar tissue.  
                    Results: Diversity in cellular phenotype between tumors was greater for the malignant B cells than for non-malignant B or T cells.  The malignant B-cell population bore little phenotypic similarity to any healthy B-cell subset, and unexpectedly clustered closer to naïve B-cell populations than GC B-cell populations. Among the non-malignant B cells within FL tumors, a significant lack of GC and plasmablast B cells was observed relative to tonsil controls.  In contrast, non-malignant T cells in FL tumors were present at levels similar to their cognate tonsillar T-cell subsets.
                  ",Conclusion:  Mass cytometry revealed that diverse HLA-DR expression on FL cells within individual tumors contributed greatly to tumor heterogeneity.  Both malignant and non-malignant B cells in the tumor bore little phenotypic resemblance to healthy GC B cells despite the presence of T follicular helper cells in the tumor. These findings suggest that ongoing signaling interactions between malignant B cells and intra-tumor T cells shape the tumor microenvironment.,,[B cells][follicular lymphoma][mass cytometry][CyTOF][viSNE],[27933753],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27933753, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5506779","[Sample Type = FL Tumor(16), Tonsil(6)]",22,51,Cara Wogsland,Kanutte Huse,Cara Wogsland,2014-04-24 - 2016-11-15,2014-04-24,2016-11-15,2016-11-01,2016-11-01,"Vanderbilt University,  Cancer Biology, Nashville, TN (USA)","Funding sources: Study and researchers were supported by NIH/NCI R00 CA143231 (J.M.I.), F31 CA199993 (A.R.G.), the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC, P30 CA68485), a VICC Ambassadors award (J.M.I.), and The Norwegian Cancer Society (K.H.).",None,,,,1159.772,52.717,22,220.387,10.018,FCS3.0(22),DVSSCIENCES-CYTOF-5.1.648(22)

The uptake and intracellular target in malignant melanoma cells was more ambiguous and the intracellular target of PTAA in transformed cells is still elusive. PTAA was well tolerated by both cell lines, and microscopic analysis as well as viability assays showed no signs of negative influence on growth. Stained cells maintained their proliferation rate for at least 12 generations. Although the probe itself was non-toxic, photo-induced cellular toxicity was observed in both cell lines upon light exposure of freshly stained cells. However, no cytotoxicity was detected when the cells were exposed to light 24 h after staining, indicating that the photo-induced toxicity is dependent on the cellular location of the probe.","Overall, these studies certified PTAA as a useful agent for vital staining of specific cells, and that PTAA can potentially be utilized to study cancer-related biological and pathological processes.",I really hate FlowRepository,[fluorescence][fIbroblast][Conjugated polyelectrolyte][luminescent conjugated polythiophene][melanoma],,,,,60,Marek Los,Marek Los,Marek Los,2012-11-25 - 2028-01-01,2012-11-25,2028-01-01,2014-12-01,2015-01-01,"German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin, a Leibniz-Institute (DRFZ),  Immunemonitoring, Berlin,  (Germany)",Not disclosed,non-stained samples were used as controls,154|ACCA,,Fig_2_Kinetic.tiff,235.001,19.583,12,28.897,2.408,FCS2.0(12),Gallios(12)

FR-FCM-ZZXZ,FR-FCM-ZZXZ,768,Contrasting frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations affecting gene expression,"Heritable differences in gene expression are caused by mutations in DNA sequences encoding cis¬-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors. These two classes of regulatory change differ in their relative contributions to expression differences in natural populations and are the result of the combined effects of mutation and natural selection. Here, we investigate how new mutations create the regulatory variation upon which natural selection acts by quantifying the frequencies and effects of hundreds of new cis- and trans-acting mutations altering activity of the TDH3 promoter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of natural selection. We find that cis-regulatory mutations have larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory mutations and that while trans-regulatory mutations are more common overall, cis- and trans-regulatory changes in expression are equally abundant when only the largest changes in expression are considered. In addition, we find that cis-regulatory mutations are skewed towards decreased expression while trans-regulatory mutations are skewed towards increased expression. We also measure the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations on the variability in gene expression among genetically identical cells, a property of gene expression known as expression noise, finding that trans-regulatory mutations are much more likely to decrease expression noise than cis-regulatory mutations. Because new mutations are the raw material upon which natural selection acts, these differences in the frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations should be considered when creating models of regulatory evolution.",None,,,[26782996],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26782996, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909133",,,16,Brian Metzger,Patricia Wittkopp,Brian Metzger,2015-01-01 - 2015-12-31,2015-01-01,2015-12-31,2015-12-01,2017-06-01,None,Not disclosed,None,,,,218383.753,15.797,13824,11706.296,0.847,FCS3.0(13824),"BD Accuri C6(12384), IntelliCyt Cytometer(1440)"

FR-FCM-ZZY7,FR-FCM-ZZY7,39,Dataset 2-Flow Cytometer Sensitivity: A Quadratic Model,"                    Flow cytometer sensitivity has been well defined in the community and relates to
                    two functions: how well a dimly fluorescent population is resolved from noise or an unstained population, and how well various dim staining populations can be distinguished from each other. In both cases the goal of finding optimal instrument settings to resolve populations based on their fluorescence can be achieved by examining bead particles (microspheres) that contain sub-populations with varying amounts of fluorescence intensity.  
                    
                    We used a data provided by University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester NY. The experiment consisted of running BDtm CS&T beads on an LSRII cytometer at a series of voltages ranging from 200V to 900V at 10V intervals. This dataset was used to explore the effects of various perturbations to cytometer operations to the resulting estimates of Q and B values using the detector assigned to B515 that has the associated MESF-FITC values for the beads.

                  ","We developed an automated approach to determine a cytometer’s detection efficiency (Q) and background illumination (B) independent of a pre-defined bead set,
                    based on K-means clustering and quadratic regression. We showed that the quadratic formulation for modelling Q offers more physical insight about cytometry sensitivity than its truncated linear version. 
                    
                    The developed quadratic regression approach that takes into account intrinsic variance from both the instrument and the bead product is very crucial in this experiment. An adequate illumination correction for the usefulness of the linear regression model is not possible because a number of voltages show a saturation in the bright peak with a CV equal to zero. In the traditional linear model this would
                    incorrectly imply an illumination correction term of 0.
                    
                    As well, using K-means in place of manual gating provided for a fully automated method to calculate the Q and B quantities objectively and in a time-efficient manner. 
                    
                    We validated our approach on this  flow cytometry sensitivity data experiment  through comparison to Q and B values obtained by manual analysis. 
                    
                    Our results show a marked improvement in facilitating the use of automated analysis of flow cytometry sensitivity data sets and we conclude that using the quadratic model is more appropriate to help find optimal instrument settings
                    that resolve populations based on their fluorescence. Using the K-means in place of manual gating provides for a fully automated method to calculate Q and B objectively and efficiently.

We expected that each method would yield a distinct number of viable/pure neutrophils and that each isolation method would result in different degrees of activation of the neutrophils.","In this study, we describe a modified magnetic bead isolation protocol for enriching spleen resident neutrophils by negative selection. EasySep® and Ficoll isolation methods fail to effectively purify neutrophils and particularly, in the case of Ficoll, yield a population of cells with low viability.

FR-FCM-ZZZV,FR-FCM-ZZZV,31,flowCAP II Challenge 3,"This data set is a subset of the ICS data generated for HVTN049 (pubmed ID 21451004). The data is intracellular cytokine staining data of CD4 and CD8 T-cells from a safety and immunogenicity vaccine trial, testing for IL2, IL4, IFNg, and TNFa cytokine producing antigen specific T-cells. The goal of this experiment within the context of the flowCAP II challenge was to have automated gating methods identify cell populations that can distinguish between Gag stimulated and Env stimulated samples. The data set contains 54 samples, half of which were used from training and half of which were used for testing purposes in the challenge. Post-hoc analysis included a comparison against manually gated data and a placebo-treated control group.","Many of the automated gating methods were able to identify IL2+/CD4+ populations  that discriminated between Env and Gag stimulated samples. These same features were found using manual gating, demonstrating that automated gating can perform as well as manual gating for this particular data set.","Several control and stimulated samples in the flowCAP II data set were taken from mismatched plates, meaning that the control and stimulated samples from an individual were run on different plates. This led to an observable plate-effect in some of the features. The mismatched samples are annotated in the data set submission. Note that this issue does not impact the original HVTN049 trial data, but is  a data manipulation error in the preparation of the flowCAP II challenge 3 data set.",[FlowCAP][Bioinformatics][Intracellular Cytokine Staining][HVTN][ICS],[21451004],"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21451004, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23396282, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3906045, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068023",,,64,Greg Finak,Raphael Gottardo,Greg Finak,2011-05-01 - 2011-10-31,2011-05-01,2011-10-31,2012-02-01,2013-01-01,"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA (USA)",Not disclosed,"The HVTN049 data was subject to extensive quality controls as described in PMID 21451004, and related publications.",,,Challenge3Metadata.csv,46027.596,191.782,240,2107.624,8.782,FCS3.0(240),(240)
